In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to perform 1st- and 2nd-order spatial point patterns analysis and derive kernel density estimation (KDE) layer\n\n-   [**raster**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/) which reads, writes, manipulates, analyses and model of gridded spatial data (i.e.Â raster). In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to convert image output generate by spatstat into raster format.\n\n-   [**maptools**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools/index.html) which provides a set of tools for manipulating geographic data. In this hands-on exercise, we mainly use it to convert *Spatial* objects into *ppp* format of **spatstat**.\n\n-   [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html) which provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps by using [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) API.\n\n-   [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling and visualising data.\n\nThe packages are loaded with the following code chunk:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf,spatstat,raster,tmap,tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Importing Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrdacc_sf <- read_csv(\"data/thai_road_accident_2019_2022.csv\") %>%\n  filter(!is.na(longitude) & longitude != \"\",\n         !is.na(latitude) & latitude != \"\") %>%\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\n    \"longitude\", \"latitude\"),\n    crs=4326) %>%\n  st_transform(crs = 32647)\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Note that **incident_datetime** and **report_datetime** are kept in **datetime field**, so that easier for manipulation later on i.e. extracting day of week, time of day. Can be useful in determining the occurrence of incidents at a particular timing i.e. peak hour.\n\n-   when file is read in sf, can easily convert to ppp\n\n-   dissecting the code - it comes in 4 chunks:\n\n    -   the first to load the file\n\n    -   the second to filter missing values\n\n    -   the third is to get the coordinates and transform the crs\n\n    -   transform it\n\n-   without the filter function in between, running the code will give you error, this is because there are missing values for longitude and latitude\n",
