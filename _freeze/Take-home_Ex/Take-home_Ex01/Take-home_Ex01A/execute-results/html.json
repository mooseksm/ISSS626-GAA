Background\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), road traffic accidents cause the death of approximately 1.19 million people each year and leave between 20 to 50 million people with non-fatal injuries. Vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists, make up more than half of all road traffic deaths.\n\nRoad traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5 to 29, however two-thirds of road traffic fatalities occur among people of working ages, from 18 to 59 years. Further, nine in 10 fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these countries make up only around 60% of the world’s vehicles.\n\nBesides human suffering, road traffic injuries also result in a heavy economic burden on victims and their families, through treatment costs for the injured and loss of productivity of those killed or disabled. More broadly, road traffic injuries have a serious impact on national economies, costing countries 3% of their annual gross domestic product.\n\nAccording to the WHO, Thailand’s roads are the deadliest in Southeast Asia and among the worst in the world - about 20,000 people die in road accidents each year, or about 56 deaths a day.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2021, Thailand experienced a notable increase in accident frequencies. Specifically, 19% of all accidents in Thailand occurred on the national highways, which make up the primary public thoroughfares connecting various regions, provinces, districts, and significant locations within a comprehensive network. Within the broader context of accidents across the country, there existed a considerable 66% likelihood of encountering accident-prone zones, often termed as ‘black spots’ which are distributed as follows: 66% on straight road segments, 13% at curves, 6% at median points of cross-shaped intersections, 5% at T-shaped intersections and Y-shaped intersections, 3% at cross-shaped intersections, 2% on bridges, and 2% on steep slopes.\n\n## 2. Objectives\n\nBy and large, road traffic accidents can be attributed by two major factors, namely behavioural and environmental factors.\n\n-   Behavioural factors in driving are considered to be major causes of traffic accidents either in direct or indirect manner (Lewin, 1982). These factors can be further grouped into driver behavior (driver/driving style) and driver performance (driver/driving skills) (Elander, West, & French, 1993).\n\n-   Environmental factors, on the other hand, includes but not limited to weather conditions such as poor visibility during heavy rain or fogs as well as road conditions such as sharp bends, slippery slopes, and [blind spots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_blind_spot).\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated the significant potential of Spatial Point Patterns Analysis (SPPA) in exploring and identifying factors influencing road traffic accidents. However, these studies often focus solely on either behavioral or environmental factors, with limited consideration of temporal factors such as season, day of the week, or time of day.\n\nIn view of this, in this hands-on exercise, we will determine factors that affect road traffic accidents in the [Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok_Metropolitan_Region) by employing both spatial and spatio-temporal point patterns analysis methods.\n\nThe specific objectives are as follows:\n\n-   To visualize the spatio-temporal dynamics of road traffic accidents in BMR using appropriate statistical graphics and geovisualization methods.\n\n-   To conduct detailed spatial analysis of road traffic accidents using appropriate Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods.\n\n-   To conduct detailed spatio-temporal analysis of road traffic accidents using appropriate Temporal Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods.\n\n## 3. Installing and Launching R packages\n\nKey packages that are installed are:\n\n-   [**sf**](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) for importing, managing, and processing vector-based geospatial data, and\n\n-   [**spatstat**](https://spatstat.org/), which has a wide range of useful functions for point pattern analysis. In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to perform 1st- and 2nd-order spatial point patterns analysis and derive kernel density estimation (KDE) layer\n\n-   [**raster**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/) which reads, writes, manipulates, analyses and model of gridded spatial data (i.e. raster). In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to convert image output generate by spatstat into raster format.\n\n-   [**maptools**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools/index.html) which provides a set of tools for manipulating geographic data. In this hands-on exercise, we mainly use it to convert *Spatial* objects into *ppp* format of **spatstat**.\n\n-   [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html) which provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps by using [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) API.\n\n-   [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling and visualising data.\n\n-   [**spNetwork**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spNetwork/index.html) which provides functions to perform Spatial Point Patterns Analysis such as kernel density estimation (KDE) and K-function on network. It can also be used to build spatial matrices (\\`listw' objects like in 'spdep' package) to conduct any kind of traditional spatial analysis with spatial weights based on reticular distances.\n\nThe packages are loaded with the following code chunk:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf,spatstat,raster,maptools,tmap,tidyverse,spNetwork,DT,forcats,ggthemes,plotly)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 4. Data\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, three basic data sets are used:\n\n-   [Thailand Road Accident \\[2019-2022\\]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thaweewatboy/thailand-road-accident-2019-2022) on Kaggle - comprised records of road accidents in Thailand from \\~2019 to 2022, based on information provided by the Office of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transport.\n\n-   [Thailand - Subnational Administrative Boundaries](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-tha?) on HDX\n\n-   [Thailand Roads (OpenStreetMap Export)](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_tha_roads) on HDX\n\n## 5. Importing, Cleaning and Wrangling Data\n\n### 5.1 Thailand Road Accident Data\n\nThe data is imported using the code below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nroadacc <- read_csv(\"data/rawdata/thai_road_accident_2019_2022.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nTaking a glimpse at the data to determine the fields in the data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(roadacc)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are 81735 rows and 18 variables. Further details about the important variables that would be needed for analysis can be found in the dropdown box below:\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## More information about variables
