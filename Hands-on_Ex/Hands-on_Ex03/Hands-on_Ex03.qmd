# Network Constrained Spatial Point Patterns Analysis

## 3.1 Overview

**Network constrained Spatial Point Patterns Analysis (NetSPAA)** is a collection of spatial point patterns analysis methods specially developed for analysing spatial point events that occur on or alongside a network. The spatial point event can be locations of traffic accidents or childcare centres for example. The network, on the other hand, can be a road network or a river network.
