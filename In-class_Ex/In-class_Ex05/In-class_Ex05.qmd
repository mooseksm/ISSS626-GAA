# In-class Exercise 5 and Lecture 5 notes

::: callout-note
## Advice from Prof Kam on Take-home Ex01:

-   there is a highway at the top of the 6 provinces - should have created a \~50m buffer around the 6 provinces then use the buffered area to clip the road lines in Bangkok Metropolitan Region

-   should sieve out short road lengths from road lines data

-   always plot data out, examine it in relation to the context to know whether data is properly prepared
