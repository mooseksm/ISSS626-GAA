To perform geoprocessing using two geospatial data, there is a need to ensure that both geospatial data are projected using a similar coordinate system.\nThe process of projecting a simple feature data frame from one coordinate system to another coordinate system is called projection transformation.\n\n\nOne common issue that can happen when importing geospatial data is either the coordinate system of the source data is missing or wrongly assigned during the importing process.\n\nst_crs(mpsz)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: SVY21 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"SVY21\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"SVY21[WGS84]\",\n        DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",6326]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]]],\n    CONVERSION[\"unnamed\",\n        METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",1.36666666666667,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",103.833333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",1,\n            SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False easting\",28001.642,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False northing\",38744.572,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"(E)\",east,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1,\n                ID[\"EPSG\",9001]]],\n        AXIS[\"(N)\",north,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1,\n                ID[\"EPSG\",9001]]]]\n\n\nWhile the mpsz data frame is projected in svy21, the end of the printout above states that the EPSG is 9001 - this is a wrong EPSG code as the correct EPSG code for svy21 should be 3414.\nTo correctly assign the right EPSG code to the mpsz data frame, st_set_crs() of sf package is used:\n\nmpsz3414 &lt;- st_set_crs(mpsz,3414)\n\nWe then check whether the EPSG code has been corrected:\n\nst_crs(mpsz3414)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: EPSG:3414 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"SVY21 / Singapore TM\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"SVY21\",\n        DATUM[\"SVY21\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        ID[\"EPSG\",4757]],\n    CONVERSION[\"Singapore Transverse Mercator\",\n        METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",1.36666666666667,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",103.833333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",1,\n            SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False easting\",28001.642,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False northing\",38744.572,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"northing (N)\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n        AXIS[\"easting (E)\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"Cadastre, engineering survey, topographic mapping.\"],\n        AREA[\"Singapore - onshore and offshore.\"],\n        BBOX[1.13,103.59,1.47,104.07]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",3414]]\n\n\n\n\n\nIn geospatial analytics, it is common to transform the original data from one geographic coordinate system to a projected coordinated system.

Maps can lie, below are some other methods of classification and different number of classes being tested out.\n\n\nkmeans data classification with 5 classes:\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n=5,\n          style=\"kmeans\")+\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkmeans data classification with 2 classes:\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n=2,\n          style=\"kmeans\")+\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfisher data classification with 5 classes:\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n=5,\n          style=\"fisher\")+\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfisher data classification with 20 classes:\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n=20,\n          style=\"fisher\")+\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all built-in styles, category breaks are computed internally. To override the defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of breaks argument to tm_fill().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn tmap, breaks include a minimum and maximum. To end up with n categories, n+1 elements must be specified in the breaks option (values must be in increasing order)\n\n\nBefore setting the break points, it is important and good practice to obtain the descriptive statistics:\n\nsummary(mpsz_pop2020$DEPENDENCY)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.0000  0.6751  0.7288  0.8084  0.8092 19.0000      92 \n\n\nWith reference to the results above, we set the break points at 0.60, 0.70, 0.80 and 0.90. We also need to include a minimum and maximum, set at 0 and 1.00 respectively.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          breaks=c(0,0.60,0.70,0.80,0.90,1.00)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap support color ramps defined by the user or a set of predefined color ramps from the RColorBrewer package.\n\n\nThis is done by assigning the preferred color to palette argument of tm_fill():\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n=6,\n          style=\"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\")+\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reverse the color shading, we add a “-” prefix:\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n=6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"-Blues\")+\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis also applies to other palette colors like Greens:\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n=6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Greens\")+\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n=6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"-Greens\")+\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap layout refers to the combination of all map elements into a cohesive map. Map elements include title, scale bar, compass, margins and aspect ratios. 1.4.3 Data classification methods of tmap and 1.4.4 Color scheme covered above affect how the map looks.\n\n\nLegend options include changing the placement, format and appearance of the legend:\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style=\"jenks\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          legend.hist = TRUE,\n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1)+\n  tm_layout(main.title=\"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone \\n(Jenks Classification)\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1,\n            legend.height = 0.45,\n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            legend.outside = FALSE,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\",\"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE)+\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA variety of layout settings that can be changed are called by using tmap_style():\nClassic style:\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"-Greens\")+\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)+\n  tmap_style(\"classic\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap also provides arguments to draw other map furniture like compass, scale bar and grid lines i.e. through the use of tm_compass(), tm_scale_bar() and tm_grid():\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"No. of persons\")+\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio \\nby planning subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45,\n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE)+\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)+\n  tm_compass(type = \"8star\",size=2)+\n  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15)+\n  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1,alpha = 0.2)+\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning subzone boundary data from Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and Population Data from Department of Statistics (DOS)\",\n             position = c(\"left\",\"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reset to default style:\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"No. of persons\")+\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio \\nby planning subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45,\n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE)+\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)+\n  tm_compass(type = \"8star\",size=2)+\n  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15)+\n  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1,alpha = 0.2)+\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning subzone boundary data from Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and Population Data from Department of Statistics (DOS)\",\n             position = c(\"left\",\"bottom\"))+\n  tmap_style(\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall multiple maps are also referred to as facet maps and comprise many maps arranged side-by-side and sometimes, stacked vertically. Facet maps enable the visualisation of how spatial relationships change with respect to another variable such as time.\nFacet maps can be plotted in 3 ways in tmap:\n\nby assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments\nby defining a group-by variable in tm_facets()\nby creating a multiple standalone maps with tmap_arrange()\n\n\n\nHere, we create facet maps by defining ncols in tm_fill():\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(c(\"YOUNG\",\"AGED\"),\n          style = \"equal\",\n          palette = \"Blues\")+\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\",\"bottom\"))+\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)+\n  tmap_style(\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother example, we assign different styles and palette:\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(c(\"DEPENDENCY\",\"AGED\"),\n          style = c(\"equal\",\"quantile\"),\n          palette = list(\"Blues\",\"Greens\"))+\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\",\"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          thres.poly = 0)+\n  tm_facets(by=\"REGION_N\",\n            free.coords = TRUE,\n            drop.shapes = TRUE)+\n  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE,\n            title.position = c(\"center\",\"center\"),\n            title.size = 20)+\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyoungmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"YOUNG\",\n              style = \"quantile\",\n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\nagedmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"AGED\",\n              style = \"quantile\",\n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\ntmap_arrange(youngmap,agedmap,asp=1,ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of creating small multiple choropleth map, a selection function can also be used to map spatial objects meeting a selection criterion:\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020[mpsz_pop2020$REGION_N==\"CENTRAL REGION\",])+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          legend.hist = TRUE,\n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1)+\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,\n            legend.height = 0.45,\n            legend.width = 5.0,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\",\"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE)+\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap: Thematic Maps in R\ntmap\ntmap: get started!\ntmap: changes in version 2.0\ntmap: creating thematic maps in a flexible way (useR!2015)\nExploring and presenting maps with tmap (useR!2017)\n\n\n\n\n\nsf: Simple Features for R\nSimple Features for R: StandardizedSupport for Spatial Vector Data\nReading, Writing and Converting Simple Features\n\n\n\n\n\ndplyr\nTidy data\ntidyr: Easily Tidy Data with ‘spread()’ and ‘gather()’ Functions"

    "text": "Spatial Point Pattern Analysis is the evaluation of the pattern or distribution of a set of points on a surface. The point can be a location of:\n\nevents such as crime, traffic incident and disease onset or\nbusiness services (coffee and fast food outlets) or facilities such as childcare and eldercare\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will use appropriate functions of spatstat to discover the spatial point processes of childcare centres in Singapore.\nThe specific questions to be addressed are as follows:\n\nare the childcare centres in Singapore randomly distributed throughout the country?\nif the answer is not, then the next question is where are the locations with higher concentrations of childcare centres?\n\n\n\n\nThree datasets are used in this exercise:\n\nCHILDCARE, a point feature data providing both location and attribute information of childcare centres. It was downloaded from data.gov.sg and is in geojson format.\nMP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL, a polygon feature data providing information of URA 2014 Master Plan Planning Subzone boundary data. It is in ESRI shapefile format. This data set was also downloaded from data.gov.sg.\nCostalOutline, a polygon feature data showing the national boundary of Singapore. It is provided by SLA and is in ESRI shapefile format.\n\n\n\n\n\nsf for importing, managing, and processing vector-based geospatial data, and\nspatstat, which has a wide range of useful functions for point pattern analysis. In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to perform 1st- and 2nd-order spatial point patterns analysis and derive kernel density estimation (KDE) layer\nraster which reads, writes, manipulates, analyses and model of gridded spatial data (i.e. raster). In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to convert image output generate by spatstat into raster format.\nmaptools which provides a set of tools for manipulating geographic data. In this hands-on exercise, we mainly use it to convert Spatial objects into ppp format of spatstat.\ntmap which provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps by using leaflet API.\ntidyverse for performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling and visualising data.\n\nThe packages are loaded with the following code chunk:\n\npacman::p_load(sf,spatstat,raster,tmap,tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nmaptools is retired and binary is removed from CRAN, however it can be downloaded from Posit Public Package Manager (this site is useful for Shiny) snapshots by using the code chunk below.

A pin map can be prepared using the code below:\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(childcare_sf)+\n  tm_dots()\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the geospatial layers are within the same map extend which indicates that their referencing system and coordinate values are referred to similar spatial context. This is very important in any geospatial analysis.\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\nAt interactive mode, tmap is using leaflet for RAPI. The advantage of an interactive pin map is it allows one to navigate and zoom around the map freely as well as query the information of each simple feature (i.e. the point) by clicking on the. The background of the internet map layer can also be changed. At present, three internet map layers are provided: ESRI.WorldGrayCanvas, OpenStreetMap, and ESRI.WorldTopoMap.

In this section, simple feature data frame will be converted to Spatial* class.\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses as_Spatial() of sf package to convert the three geospatial data from simple feature data frame to sp’s Spatial* class.\n\nchildcare &lt;- as_Spatial(childcare_sf)\nmpsz &lt;- as_Spatial(mpsz_sf3414)\nsg &lt;- as_Spatial(sg_sf3414)\n\n\nchildcare\n\nclass       : SpatialPointsDataFrame \nfeatures    : 1545 \nextent      : 11203.01, 45404.24, 25667.6, 49300.88  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs         : +proj=tmerc +lat_0=1.36666666666667 +lon_0=103.833333333333 +k=1 +x_0=28001.642 +y_0=38744.572 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs \nvariables   : 2\nnames       :    Name,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Description \nmin values  :   kml_1, &lt;center&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th colspan='2' align='center'&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attributes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"#E3E3F3\"&gt; &lt;th&gt;ADDRESSBLOCKHOUSENUMBER&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"\"&gt; &lt;th&gt;ADDRESSBUILDINGNAME&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"#E3E3F3\"&gt; &lt;th&gt;ADDRESSPOSTALCODE&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;018989&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"\"&gt; &lt;th&gt;ADDRESSSTREETNAME&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;1, MARINA BOULEVARD, #B1 - 01, ONE MARINA BOULEVARD, SINGAPORE 018989&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"#E3E3F3\"&gt; &lt;th&gt;ADDRESSTYPE&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"\"&gt; &lt;th&gt;DESCRIPTION&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"#E3E3F3\"&gt; &lt;th&gt;HYPERLINK&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"\"&gt; &lt;th&gt;LANDXADDRESSPOINT&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"#E3E3F3\"&gt; &lt;th&gt;LANDYADDRESSPOINT&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr bgcolor=\"\"&gt; &lt;th&gt;NAME&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;THE LITTLE SKOOL-HOUSE INTERNATIONAL PTE.

The statistical methodology used for spatial point patterns processes is based largely on the assumption that process is simple, that is, that the points cannot be coincidental.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can check the duplication in a ppp object using the code chunk below:\n\nany(duplicated(childcare_ppp))\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nTo count the number of coincidence points, the multiplicity() function is used, as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nmultiplicity(childcare_ppp)\n\n   [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n  [38] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n  [75] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [112] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [149] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [186] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [223] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [260] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [297] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [334] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [371] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [408] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [445] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [482] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [519] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [556] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [593] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [630] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [667] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [704] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [741] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [778] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [815] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [852] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [889] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [926] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [963] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1000] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1037] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1074] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1111] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1148] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1185] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1222] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1259] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1296] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1333] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1370] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1407] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1444] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1481] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1518] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nTo know how many locations have more than one point event, the code chunk below is used:\n\nsum(multiplicity(childcare_ppp) &gt; 1)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(childcare) +\n  tm_dots(alpha=0.4, \n          size=0.05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\nIn the event of duplicate points, there are 3 ways to overcome the issue:\n\nDelete the duplicates - easiest way but it will also meant that some useful point events will be lost\nJittering - this method will add a small perturbation to the duplicate points so that they do not occupy the exact same space\nMake each point “unique” and attach the duplicates of the points to the patterns as marks, as attributes of the points. Analytical techniques that take into account these marks would be required.\n\nThe code chunk below implements the jittering approach:\n\nchildcare_ppp_jit &lt;- rjitter(childcare_ppp, \n                             retry=TRUE, \n                             nsim=1, \n                             drop=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNote that Prof’s original code only indicated nsim = 1 which means there’s only 2 simulations. To increase the value i.e. nsim = 49 to bring the simulations up to 50.\n\n\nCheck for duplicated points:\n\nany(duplicated(childcare_ppp_jit))\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen analysing spatial point patterns, it is a good practice to confine the analysis within a geographical area like Singapore’s boundary. In spatstat, an object called owin is specially designed to represent this polygonal region.\nThe code chunk below is used to covert sg SpatialPolygon object into owin object of spatstat.\n\nsg_owin

The hands-on exercise will focus on:\n\nderiving kernel density estimation (KDE) layer for visualising and exploring the intensity of point processes,\nperforming Confirmatory Spatial Point Patterns Analysis by using Nearest Neighbour statistics.\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will compute the kernel density estimation (KDE) of childcare services in Singapore.\n\n\nThe code chunk below computes a kernel density by using the following configurations of density() of spatstat:\n\nbw.diggle() automatic bandwidth selection method. Other recommended methods are bw.CvL(), bw.scott() or bw.ppl().\nThe smoothing kernel used is gaussian, which is the default. Other smoothing methods are: “epanechnikov”, “quartic” or “disc”.\nThe intensity estimate is corrected for edge effect bias by using method described by Jones (1993) and Diggle (2010, equation 18.9). The default is FALSE.\n\n\nkde_childcareSG_bw &lt;- density(childcareSG_ppp,\n                              sigma=bw.diggle,\n                              edge=TRUE,\n                            kernel=\"gaussian\") \n\nThe plot() function of Base R is then used to display the kernel density derived.\n\nplot(kde_childcareSG_bw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe density values of the output range from 0 to 0.000035 which is way too small to comprehend. This is because the default unit of measurement of svy21 is in meter. As a result, the density values computed is in “number of points per square meter”.\nAs added info, the bandwidth used to compute the kde layer can be retrieved using the code chunk below:\n\nbw &lt;- bw.diggle(childcareSG_ppp)\nbw\n\n   sigma \n298.4095 \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, rescale.ppp() is used to covert the unit of measurement from meter to kilometer:\n\nchildcareSG_ppp.km &lt;- rescale.ppp(childcareSG_ppp, 1000, \"km\")\n\nRe-run density() using the resale data set and plot the output kde map:\n\nkde_childcareSG.bw &lt;- density(childcareSG_ppp.km, sigma=bw.diggle, edge=TRUE, kernel=\"gaussian\")\nplot(kde_childcareSG.bw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the output image looks identical to the earlier version and that the only change is in the data values (refer to the legend).\n\n\n\n\nBeside bw.diggle(), there are three other spatstat functions can be used to determine the bandwidth, they are: bw.CvL(), bw.scott(), and bw.ppl().\n\n bw.CvL(childcareSG_ppp.km)\n\n   sigma \n4.543278 \n\n\n\nbw.scott(childcareSG_ppp.km)\n\n sigma.x  sigma.y \n2.224898 1.450966 \n\n\n\nbw.ppl(childcareSG_ppp.km)\n\n    sigma \n0.3897114 \n\n\n\nbw.diggle(childcareSG_ppp.km)\n\n    sigma \n0.2984095 \n\n\nBaddeley et. (2016) suggested the use of the bw.ppl() algorithm as from their experience, this method tends to produce more appropriate values when the pattern consisted predominantly of tight clusters. However, if the purpose of thestudy is to detect a single tight cluster in the midst of random noise, the bw.diggle() method seemed to work best.\nThe code chunk beow will be used to compare the output of using bw.diggle and bw.ppl methods:\n\nkde_childcareSG.ppl &lt;- density(childcareSG_ppp.km, \n                               sigma=bw.ppl, \n                               edge=TRUE,\n                               kernel=\"gaussian\")\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(kde_childcareSG.bw, main = \"bw.diggle\")\nplot(kde_childcareSG.ppl, main = \"bw.ppl\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the kernel method used in density.ppp() is gaussian. But there are three other options, namely: Epanechnikov, Quartic and Dics.\nThe code chunk below will be used to compute three more kernel density estimations by using these three kernel function:\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(density(childcareSG_ppp.km, \n             sigma=bw.ppl, \n             edge=TRUE, \n             kernel=\"gaussian\"), \n     main=\"Gaussian\")\nplot(density(childcareSG_ppp.km, \n             sigma=bw.ppl, \n             edge=TRUE, \n             kernel=\"epanechnikov\"), \n     main=\"Epanechnikov\")\nplot(density(childcareSG_ppp.km, \n             sigma=bw.ppl, \n             edge=TRUE, \n             kernel=\"quartic\"), \n     main=\"Quartic\")\nplot(density(childcareSG_ppp.km, \n             sigma=bw.ppl, \n             edge=TRUE, \n             kernel=\"disc\"), \n     main=\"Disc\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, a KDE layer will be computed by defining a bandwidth of 600 meter. In the code chunk below, the sigma value used is 0.6. as the unit of measurement of childcareSG_ppp.km object is in kilometer, hence the 600m is 0.6km.\n\nkde_childcareSG_600 &lt;- density(childcareSG_ppp.km, sigma=0.6, edge=TRUE, kernel=\"gaussian\")\nplot(kde_childcareSG_600)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed bandwidth method is very sensitive to highly skew distribution of spatial point patterns over geographical units for example urban versus rural. One way to overcome this problem is by using adaptive bandwidth instead.\nIn this section, adaptive kernel density estimation will be derived using density.adaptive() of spatstat.\n\nkde_childcareSG_adaptive &lt;- adaptive.density(childcareSG_ppp.km, method=\"kernel\")\nplot(kde_childcareSG_adaptive)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can compare the fixed and adaptive kernel density estimation outputs by using the code chunk below.\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(kde_childcareSG.bw, main = \"Fixed bandwidth\")\nplot(kde_childcareSG_adaptive, main = \"Adaptive bandwidth\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe convert the result to be suitable for mapping purposes:\n\ngridded_kde_childcareSG_bw &lt;- as.im(kde_childcareSG.bw)\nplot(gridded_kde_childcareSG_bw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, the gridded kernal density objects will be converted into a RasterLayer object by using raster() of raster package:\n\nkde_childcareSG_bw_raster &lt;- raster(kde_childcareSG.bw)\n\nTaking a look at the properties of kde_childcareSG_bw_raster RasterLayer:\n\nkde_childcareSG_bw_raster\n\nclass      : RasterLayer \ndimensions : 128, 128, 16384  (nrow, ncol, ncell)\nresolution : 0.4170614, 0.2647348  (x, y)\nextent     : 2.663926, 56.04779,

NA.\n\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to include the CRS information on kde_childcareSG_bw_raster RasterLayer:\n\nprojection(kde_childcareSG_bw_raster) &lt;-

\nsource     : memory\nnames      : layer \nvalues     : -8.476185e-15, 28.51831  (min, max)\n\n\nThe crs property is now completed.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we will display the raster in cartographic quality map using tmap package:\n\ntm_shape(kde_childcareSG_bw_raster) + \n  tm_raster(\"layer\", palette = \"viridis\") +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"), frame = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the raster values are encoded explicitly onto the raster pixel using the values in “v”” field.\n\n\n\nIn this section, the KDE of childcare at Ponggol, Tampines, Chua Chu Kang and Jurong West planning areas will be compared.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to extract the target planning areas.\n\npg &lt;- mpsz_sf %&gt;%\n  filter(PLN_AREA_N == \"PUNGGOL\")\ntm &lt;- mpsz_sf %&gt;%\n  filter(PLN_AREA_N == \"TAMPINES\")\nck &lt;- mpsz_sf %&gt;%\n  filter(PLN_AREA_N == \"CHOA CHU KANG\")\njw &lt;- mpsz_sf %&gt;%\n  filter(PLN_AREA_N == \"JURONG WEST\")\n\nPlotting target planning areas:\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(pg, main = \"Punggol\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(tm, main = \"Tampines\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(ck, main = \"Choa Chu Kang\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(jw, main = \"Jurong West\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we will convert these sf objects into owin objects that is required by spatstat:\n\npg_owin = as.owin(pg)\ntm_owin = as.owin(tm)\nck_owin = as.owin(ck)\njw_owin = as.owin(jw)\n\n\n\n\nBy using the code chunk below, we are able to extract childcare that is within the specific region to do our analysis later on.\n\nchildcare_pg_ppp = childcare_ppp_jit[pg_owin]\nchildcare_tm_ppp = childcare_ppp_jit[tm_owin]\nchildcare_ck_ppp = childcare_ppp_jit[ck_owin]\nchildcare_jw_ppp = childcare_ppp_jit[jw_owin]\n\n\nclass(childcare_pg_ppp)\n\n[1] \"ppp\"\n\nclass(childcare_tm_ppp)\n\n[1] \"ppp\"\n\nclass(childcare_ck_ppp)\n\n[1] \"ppp\"\n\nclass(childcare_jw_ppp)\n\n[1] \"ppp\"\n\n\nNext, rescale.ppp() function is used to transform the unit of measurement from metre to kilometre:\n\nchildcare_pg_ppp.km = rescale.ppp(childcare_pg_ppp, 1000, \"km\")\nchildcare_tm_ppp.km = rescale.ppp(childcare_tm_ppp, 1000, \"km\")\nchildcare_ck_ppp.km = rescale.ppp(childcare_ck_ppp, 1000, \"km\")\nchildcare_jw_ppp.km = rescale.ppp(childcare_jw_ppp, 1000, \"km\")\n\nThe code chunk below is used to plot these four study areas and the locations of the childcare centres:\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(childcare_pg_ppp.km, main=\"Punggol\")\nplot(childcare_tm_ppp.km, main=\"Tampines\")\nplot(childcare_ck_ppp.km, main=\"Choa Chu Kang\")\nplot(childcare_jw_ppp.km, main=\"Jurong West\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to compute the KDE of these four planning area. bw.diggle method is used to derive the bandwidth of each area:\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(density(childcare_pg_ppp.km, \n             sigma=bw.diggle, \n             edge=TRUE, \n             kernel=\"gaussian\"),\n     main=\"Punggol\")\nplot(density(childcare_tm_ppp.km, \n             sigma=bw.diggle, \n

main=\"Jurong West\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor comparison purposes, 250m will be used as the bandwidth:\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(density(childcare_ck_ppp.km, \n             sigma=0.25, \n

This is very important in any geospatial analysis.\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\nAt interactive mode, tmap is using leaflet for RAPI. The advantage of an interactive pin map is it allows one to navigate and zoom around the map freely as well as query the information of each simple feature (i.e. the point) by clicking on the. The background of the internet map layer can also be changed. At present, three internet map layers are provided: ESRI.WorldGrayCanvas, OpenStreetMap, and ESRI.WorldTopoMap. The default is ESRI.WorldGrayCanvas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is always important to switch back to plot mode after the interactive map as each interactive mode will consume a connection.\nIt is important to avoid displaying excessive number of interactive maps i.e. not more than 10, in one RMarkdown document when publishing on Netlify."

The statistical methodology used for spatial point patterns processes is based largely on the assumption that process is simple, that is, that the points cannot be coincidental.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can check the duplication in a ppp object using the code chunk below:\n\nany(duplicated(childcare_ppp))\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nTo count the number of coincidence points, the multiplicity() function is used, as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nmultiplicity(childcare_ppp)\n\n   [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n  [38] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n  [75] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [112] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [149] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [186] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [223] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [260] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [297] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [334] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [371] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [408] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [445] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [482] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [519] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [556] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [593] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [630] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [667] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [704] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [741] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [778] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [815] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [852] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [889] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [926] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [963] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1000] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1037] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1074] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1111] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1148] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1185] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1222] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1259] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1296] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1333] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1370] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1407] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1444] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1481] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n[1518] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nTo know how many locations have more than one point event, the code chunk below is used:\n\nsum(multiplicity(childcare_ppp) &gt; 1)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(childcare) +\n  tm_dots(alpha=0.4, \n          size=0.05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\nIn the event of duplicate points, there are 3 ways to overcome the issue:\n\nDelete the duplicates - easiest way but it will also meant that some useful point events will be lost\nJittering - this method will add a small perturbation to the duplicate points so that they do not occupy the exact same space\nMake each point “unique” and attach the duplicates of the points to the patterns as marks, as attributes of the points. Analytical techniques that take into account these marks would be required.\n\nThe code chunk below implements the jittering approach:\n\nchildcare_ppp_jit &lt;- rjitter(childcare_ppp, \n                             retry=TRUE, \n                             nsim=1, \n                             drop=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNote that Prof’s original code only indicated nsim = 1 which means there’s only 2 simulations. To increase the value i.e. nsim = 49 to bring the simulations up to 50.\n\n\nCheck for duplicated points:\n\nany(duplicated(childcare_ppp_jit))\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen analysing spatial point patterns, it is a good practice to confine the analysis within a geographical area like Singapore’s boundary. In spatstat, an object called owin is specially designed to represent this polygonal region.\nThe code chunk below is used to covert sg SpatialPolygon object into owin object of spatstat.\n\nsg_owin

    "text": "In this section, first-order SPPA will be performed using spatstat package. The hands-on exercise will focus on:\n\nderiving kernel density estimation (KDE) layer for visualising and exploring the intensity of point processes,\nperforming Confirmatory Spatial Point Patterns Analysis by using Nearest Neighbour statistics.\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will compute the kernel density estimation (KDE) of childcare services in Singapore.\n\n\nThe code chunk below computes a kernel density by using the following configurations of density() of spatstat:\n\nbw.diggle() automatic bandwidth selection method. Other recommended methods are bw.CvL(), bw.scott() or bw.ppl().\nThe smoothing kernel used is gaussian, which is the default. Other smoothing methods are: “epanechnikov”, “quartic” or “disc”.\nThe intensity estimate is corrected for edge effect bias by using method described by Jones (1993) and Diggle (2010, equation 18.9). The default is FALSE.\n\n\nkde_childcareSG_bw &lt;- density(childcareSG_ppp,\n                              sigma=bw.diggle,\n                              edge=TRUE,\n                            kernel=\"gaussian\") \n\nThe plot() function of Base R is then used to display the kernel density derived.\n\nplot(kde_childcareSG_bw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe density values of the output range from 0 to 0.000035 which is way too small to comprehend. This is because the default unit of measurement of svy21 is in meter. As a result, the density values computed is in “number of points per square meter”.\nAs added info, the bandwidth used to compute the kde layer can be retrieved using the code chunk below:\n\nbw &lt;- bw.diggle(childcareSG_ppp)\nbw\n\n   sigma \n298.4095 \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, rescale.ppp() is used to covert the unit of measurement from meter to kilometer:\n\nchildcareSG_ppp.km &lt;- rescale.ppp(childcareSG_ppp, 1000, \"km\")\n\nRe-run density() using the resale data set and plot the output kde map:\n\nkde_childcareSG.bw &lt;- density(childcareSG_ppp.km, sigma=bw.diggle, edge=TRUE, kernel=\"gaussian\")\nplot(kde_childcareSG.bw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the output image looks identical to the earlier version and that the only change is in the data values (refer to the legend).\n\n\n\n\nBeside bw.diggle(), there are three other spatstat functions can be used to determine the bandwidth, they are: bw.CvL(), bw.scott(), and bw.ppl().\n\n bw.CvL(childcareSG_ppp.km)\n\n   sigma \n4.543278 \n\n\n\nbw.scott(childcareSG_ppp.km)\n\n sigma.x  sigma.y \n2.224898 1.450966 \n\n\n\nbw.ppl(childcareSG_ppp.km)\n\n    sigma \n0.3897114 \n\n\n\nbw.diggle(childcareSG_ppp.km)\n\n    sigma \n0.2984095 \n\n\nBaddeley et. (2016) suggested the use of the bw.ppl() algorithm as from their experience, this method tends to produce more appropriate values when the pattern consisted predominantly of tight clusters. However, if the purpose of thestudy is to detect a single tight cluster in the midst of random noise, the bw.diggle() method seemed to work best.\nThe code chunk beow will be used to compare the output of using bw.diggle and bw.ppl methods:\n\nkde_childcareSG.ppl &lt;- density(childcareSG_ppp.km, \n                               sigma=bw.ppl, \n                               edge=TRUE,\n                               kernel=\"gaussian\")\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(kde_childcareSG.bw, main = \"bw.diggle\")\nplot(kde_childcareSG.ppl, main = \"bw.ppl\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the kernel method used in density.ppp() is gaussian. But there are three other options, namely: Epanechnikov, Quartic and Dics.\nThe code chunk below will be used to compute three more kernel density estimations by using these three kernel function:\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(density(childcareSG_ppp.km, \n             sigma=bw.ppl, \n             edge=TRUE, \n             kernel=\"gaussian\"), \n     main=\"Gaussian\")\nplot(density(childcareSG_ppp.km, \n             sigma=bw.ppl, \n             edge=TRUE, \n             kernel=\"epanechnikov\"), \n     main=\"Epanechnikov\")\nplot(density(childcareSG_ppp.km, \n             sigma=bw.ppl, \n             edge=TRUE, \n             kernel=\"quartic\"), \n     main=\"Quartic\")\nplot(density(childcareSG_ppp.km, \n             sigma=bw.ppl, \n             edge=TRUE, \n             kernel=\"disc\"), \n     main=\"Disc\")"

using raster() of raster package:\n\nkde_childcareSG_bw_raster &lt;- raster(kde_childcareSG.bw)\n\nTaking a look at the properties of kde_childcareSG_bw_raster

Chu Kang and Jurong West planning areas will be compared.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to extract the target planning areas.\n\npg &lt;- mpsz_sf %&gt;%\n  filter(PLN_AREA_N ==

    "text": "Spatial Point Pattern Analysis is the evaluation of the pattern or distribution of a set of points on a surface. The point can be a location of:\n\nevents such as crime, traffic incident and disease onset or\nbusiness services (coffee and fast food outlets) or facilities such as childcare and eldercare\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will use appropriate functions of spatstat to discover the spatial point processes of childcare centres in Singapore.\nThe specific questions to be addressed are as follows:\n\nare the childcare centres in Singapore randomly distributed throughout the country?\nif the answer is not, then the next question is where are the locations with higher concentrations of childcare centres?\n\n\n\n\nThree datasets are used in this exercise:\n\nCHILDCARE, a point feature data providing both location and attribute information of childcare centres. It was downloaded from data.gov.sg and is in geojson format.\nMP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL, a polygon feature data providing information of URA 2014 Master Plan Planning Subzone boundary data. It is in ESRI shapefile format. This data set was also downloaded from data.gov.sg.\nCostalOutline, a polygon feature data showing the national boundary of Singapore. It is provided by SLA and is in ESRI shapefile format.\n\n\n\n\n\nsf for importing, managing, and processing vector-based geospatial data, and\nspatstat, which has a wide range of useful functions for point pattern analysis.

A pin map can be prepared using the code below:\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(childcare_sf)+\n  tm_dots()\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the geospatial layers are within the same map extend which indicates that their referencing system and coordinate values are referred to similar spatial context. This is very important in any geospatial analysis.\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\nAt interactive mode, tmap is using leaflet for RAPI. The advantage of an interactive pin map is it allows one to navigate and zoom around the map freely as well as query the information of each simple feature (i.e. the point) by clicking on the. The background of the internet map layer can also be changed. At present, three internet map layers are provided: ESRI.WorldGrayCanvas, OpenStreetMap, and ESRI.WorldTopoMap.

Analytical techniques that take into account these marks would be required.\n\nThe code chunk below implements the jittering approach:\n\nchildcare_ppp_jit &lt;- rjitter(childcare_ppp, \n                             retry=TRUE, \n                             nsim=1, \n                             drop=TRUE)\n\nCheck for duplicated points:\n\nany(duplicated(childcare_ppp_jit))\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen analysing spatial point patterns, it is a good practice to confine the analysis within a geographical area like Singapore’s boundary.

A pin map can be prepared using the code below:\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(childcare_sf)+\n  tm_dots()\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the geospatial layers are within the same map extend which indicates that their referencing system and coordinate values are referred to similar spatial context. This is very important in any geospatial analysis.\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\nAt interactive mode, tmap is using leaflet for RAPI. The advantage of an interactive pin map is it allows one to navigate and zoom around the map freely as well as query the information of each simple feature (i.e. the point) by clicking on the. The background of the internet map layer can also be changed. At present, three internet map layers are provided: ESRI.WorldGrayCanvas, OpenStreetMap, and ESRI.WorldTopoMap. The default is ESRI.WorldGrayCanvas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is always important to switch back to plot mode after the interactive map as each interactive mode will consume a connection.\nIt is important to avoid displaying excessive number of interactive maps i.e. not more than 10, in one RMarkdown document when publishing on Netlify."

Analytical techniques that take into account these marks would be required.\n\nThe code chunk below implements the jittering approach:\n\nchildcare_ppp_jit &lt;- rjitter(childcare_ppp, \n                             retry=TRUE, \n                             nsim=1, \n                             drop=TRUE)\n\nCheck for duplicated points:\n\nany(duplicated(childcare_ppp_jit))\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen analysing spatial point patterns, it is a good practice to confine the analysis within a geographical area like Singapore’s boundary. In spatstat, an object called owin is specially designed to represent this polygonal region.\nThe code chunk below is used to covert sg SpatialPolygon object into owin object of spatstat.\n\nsg_owin

good practice to visualise the geospatial data. There are two ways to do so.\nOne way is to use plot() of Base R as shown in the code chunk below:\n\nplot(st_geometry(network))\nplot(childcare,add=T,col='red',pch=19)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA second way is to use the mapping function of tmap package to visualise the geospatial data with high cartographic quality and in an interactive manner:\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(childcare)+\n  tm_dots()+\n  tm_shape(network)+\n  tm_lines()\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will perform NKDE analysis using appropriate functions provided in the spNetwork package.\n\n\nBefore computing NKDE, the Spatial Lines object needs to be cut into lixels with a specified minimal distance. This task can be performed using lixelize_lines() of spNetwork:\n\nlixels &lt;- lixelize_lines(network,\n                         700,\n                         mindist = 375)\n\nIn the code above,\n\nlength of a lixel, lx_length, is set to 700m and\nminimum length of a lixel, mindist, is set to 350m\n\nAfter cutting, if the length of the final lixel is shorter than the minimum distance, it is added to the previous lixel. If NULL, the mindist = maxdist/10. Also note that the segments that are already shorter than the minimum distance are not modified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere is another function called lixelize_lines.mc() which provides multicore support.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, lines_center() of spNetwork will be used to generate a SpatialPointsDataFrame i.e. samples, with line center points as shown in the code chunk below:\n\nsamples &lt;- lines_center(lixels)\n\nThe points are located at the center of the line based on the length of the line.\n\n\n\n\ndensities &lt;- nkde(network,\n                  events = childcare,\n                  w = rep(1, nrow(childcare)),\n                  samples = samples,\n                  kernel_name = \"quartic\",\n                  bw = 300,\n                  div = \"bw\",\n                  method = \"simple\",\n                  digits = 1,\n                  tol = 1,\n                  grid_shape = c(1,1),\n                  max_depth = 8,\n                  agg = 5,\n                  sparse = TRUE,\n                  verbose = FALSE)\n\nUsing the code above gives an error message that the number of columns of arguments do not match. Comparing both dataframes, it is noted that the childcare dataframe contain points that have z coordinates aka points are 3D while network dataframe contain points in 2D format. Based on Details on NKDE, it seems like 2D points are required for the computation and hence an additional step of dropping the z-dimension of points in childcare dataframe is required. This is done using the st_zm() function:\n\nchildcare &lt;- st_zm(childcare)\n\nRerunning the NKDE computation code:\n\ndensities &lt;- nkde(network,\n                  events = childcare,\n                  w = rep(1, nrow(childcare)),\n                  samples = samples,\n                  kernel_name = \"quartic\",\n                  bw = 300,\n                  div = \"bw\",\n                  method = \"simple\",\n                  digits = 1,\n                  tol = 1,\n                  grid_shape = c(1,1),\n                  max_depth = 8,\n                  agg = 5,\n                  sparse = TRUE,\n                  verbose = FALSE)\n\nLearning lessons from the code chunk above:\n\nkernel_name argument indicates that quartic kernel is used. Other possible kernel methods supported by spNetwork are triangle, gaussian, scaled gaussian, tricube, cosine, triweight, epanechnikov or uniform\nmethod argument indicate that simple method is used to calculate the NKDE. At present, spNetwork support three popular methods:\n\nsimple: this method proposes an intuitive solution. The distances between events and sampling points are replaced by network distances, and the formula of the kernel is adapted to calculate the density over a linear unit instead of an area unit.\ndiscontinuous: this method equally divides the mass density of an event at intersections of lixels.\ncontinuous: if the discontinuous method is unbiased, it leads to a discontinuous kernel function which is counter-intuitive. The continuous method divides the mass density at the intersection but adjusts the density before the intersection to make the function continuous.\n\n\n\n\nBefore visualising NKDE values, the code chunk below will be used to insert the computed density values i.e. densities into the samples and lixel objects as density field:\n\nsamples$density &lt;- densities\nlixels$density &lt;- densities\n\nSince the SVY21 projection system is in metres, the computed density values are very small i.e. 0.0000005. The code chunk below is used to rescale the density values from the number of events per metre to number of events per kilometre, to help the mapping:\n\nsamples$density &lt;- samples$density*1000\nlixels$density &lt;- lixels$density*1000\n\nThe code below then uses appropriate functions of tmap package to prepare interactive and high cartographic quality map visualisation:\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(lixels)+\n  tm_lines(col = \"density\")+\ntm_shape(childcare)+\n  tm_dots()\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, complete spatial randomness (CSR) test will be performed using kfunctions() of spNetwork package. The null hypothesis is defined as such:\nH0: The observed spatial point events (i.e. distribution of childcare centres) are uniformly distributed over a street network in Punggol Planning Area.\nThe CSR test is based on the assumption of the binomial point process which implies the hypothesis that the childcare centres are randomly and independently distributed over the street network.\nIf the hypothesis is rejected, we may infer that the distribution of the childcare centres is spatially interacting and dependent on each other and thus, may form non-random patterns.\n\nkfun_childcare &lt;- kfunctions(network,\n                             childcare,\n                             start = 0,\n                             end = 1000,\n                             step = 50,\n                             width = 50,\n                             nsim = 50,\n                             resolution = 50,\n                             verbose = FALSE,\n                             conf_int = 0.05)\n\nLearning points from the code chunk above - there are 10 arguments used in the code chunk:\n\nlines: a SpatialLinesDataFrame with the sampling points. The geometries must be a SpatialLinesDataFrame else it may crash if there are invalid geometries\npoints: a SpatialPointsDataFrame representing the points on the network. These points will be snapped on the network.\nstart: a double, the start value for evaluating K- and G-functions\nend: a double, the last value for evaluating K- and G-functions\nstep: a double, the jump for evaluating the K- and G-functions\nwidth: width of each donut for the G-function\nnsim: indicates the number of Monte Carlo simulations required. Most of the time, more simulations are required for inference\nresolution: when simulating random points on the network, selecting a resolution will greatly reduce the calculation time. When the resolution is null, the random points can occur everywhere on the graph. If a value is specified, the edges are split according to this value and the random points will be selected vertices on the new network.\nconf_int: a double, indicating the width confidence interval (default = 0.05)\n\nThe output of kfunctions() is a list with the following values:\n\nplotkA: ggplot2 object representing the values of the k-function\nplotgA: ggplot2 object representing the values of the g-function\nvaluesA: a dataframe with the values used to build the plots\n\nThe ggplot2 object of k-function can be visualised using the code chunk below:\n\nkfun_childcare$plotk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blue line is the empirical network K-function of the childcare centres in Punggol Planning Area. The gray envelope represents the results of the 50 simulations in the interval of 2.5% to 97.5%. As the blue line between the distances of 250m to 400m is below the gray area, we can infer that the childcare centres in Punggol Planning Area resemble regular pattern at the distance of 250m to 400m.\n\n\n\n\nspNetwork: Spatial Analysis on Network\nNetwork Kernel Density Estimate\nDetails about NKDE\nNetwork k Functions"

    "text": "In this section, we will perform NKDE analysis using appropriate functions provided in the spNetwork package.\n\n\nBefore computing NKDE, the Spatial Lines object needs to be cut into lixels with a specified minimal distance. This task can be performed using lixelize_lines() of spNetwork:\n\nlixels &lt;- lixelize_lines(network,\n                         700,\n                         mindist = 375)\n\nIn the code above,\n\nlength of a lixel, lx_length, is set to 700m and\nminimum length of a lixel, mindist, is set to 350m\n\nAfter cutting, if the length of the final lixel is shorter than the minimum distance, it is added to the previous lixel. If NULL, the mindist = maxdist/10. Also note that the segments that are already shorter than the minimum distance are not modified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere is another function called lixelize_lines.mc() which provides multicore support.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, lines_center() of spNetwork will be used to generate a SpatialPointsDataFrame i.e. samples, with line center points as shown in the code chunk below:\n\nsamples &lt;- lines_center(lixels)\n\nThe points are located at the center of the line based on the length of the line.\n\n\n\n\ndensities &lt;- nkde(network,\n                  events = childcare,\n                  w = rep(1, nrow(childcare)),\n                  samples = samples,\n                  kernel_name = \"quartic\",\n                  bw = 300,\n                  div = \"bw\",\n                  method = \"simple\",\n                  digits = 1,\n                  tol = 1,\n                  grid_shape = c(1,1),\n                  max_depth = 8,\n                  agg = 5,\n                  sparse = TRUE,\n                  verbose = FALSE)\n\nUsing the code above gives an error message that the number of columns of arguments do not match. Comparing both dataframes, it is noted that the childcare dataframe contain points that have z coordinates aka points are 3D while network dataframe contain points in 2D format. Based on Details on NKDE, it seems like 2D points are required for the computation and hence an additional step of dropping the z-dimension of points in childcare dataframe is required. This is done using the st_zm() function:\n\nchildcare &lt;- st_zm(childcare)\n\nRerunning the NKDE computation code:\n\ndensities &lt;- nkde(network,\n                  events = childcare,\n                  w = rep(1, nrow(childcare)),\n                  samples = samples,\n                  kernel_name = \"quartic\",\n                  bw = 300,\n                  div = \"bw\",\n                  method = \"simple\",\n                  digits = 1,\n                  tol = 1,\n                  grid_shape = c(1,1),\n                  max_depth = 8,\n                  agg = 5,\n                  sparse = TRUE,\n                  verbose = FALSE)\n\nLearning lessons from the code chunk above:\n\nkernel_name argument indicates that quartic kernel is used. Other possible kernel methods supported by spNetwork are triangle, gaussian, scaled gaussian, tricube, cosine, triweight, epanechnikov or uniform\nmethod argument indicate that simple method is used to calculate the NKDE. At present, spNetwork support three popular methods:\n\nsimple: this method proposes an intuitive solution. The distances between events and sampling points are replaced by network distances, and the formula of the kernel is adapted to calculate the density over a linear unit instead of an area unit.\ndiscontinuous: this method equally divides the mass density of an event at intersections of lixels.\ncontinuous: if the discontinuous method is unbiased, it leads to a discontinuous kernel function which is counter-intuitive. The continuous method divides the mass density at the intersection but adjusts the density before the intersection to make the function continuous.\n\n\n\n\nBefore visualising NKDE values, the code chunk below will be used to insert the computed density values i.e. densities into the samples and lixel objects as density field:\n\nsamples$density &lt;- densities\nlixels$density &lt;- densities\n\nSince the SVY21 projection system is in metres, the computed density values are very small i.e. 0.0000005. The code chunk below is used to rescale the density values from the number of events per metre to number of events per kilometre, to help the mapping:\n\nsamples$density &lt;- samples$density*1000\nlixels$density &lt;- lixels$density*1000\n\nThe code below then uses appropriate functions of tmap package to prepare interactive and high cartographic quality map visualisation:\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(lixels)+\n  tm_lines(col = \"density\")+\ntm_shape(childcare)+\n  tm_dots()\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap_mode('plot')"

    "text": "Network constrained Spatial Point Patterns Analysis (NetSPAA) is a collection of spatial point patterns analysis methods specially developed for analysing spatial point events that occur on or alongside a network. The spatial point event can be locations of traffic accidents or childcare centres for example.

For this study, two geospatial datasets will be used:\n\nPunggol_St, a line features geospatial data which stores the road network within the Punggol Planning Area\nPunggol_CC, a point features geospatial data which stores the location of childcare centres within the Punggol Planning Area\n\nBoth datasets are in the ESRI shapefile format.\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, four R packages will be used:\n\nspNetwork which provides functions to perform Spatial Point Patterns Analysis such as kernel density estimation (KDE) and K-function on network. It can also be used to build spatial matrices (`listw’ objects like in ‘spdep’ package) to conduct any kind of traditional spatial analysis with spatial weights based on reticular distances.\nsf package provides functions to manage, process and manipulate Simple Features, a formal geospatial data standard that specifies a storage and access model of spatial geometries such as points, lines and polygons.\ntmap which provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point pattern maps or interactive maps by using leaflet API\n\n\npacman:::p_load(spNetwork,sf,tmap,tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses st_read() of sf package to import Punggol_St and Pungol_CC geospatial datasets into RStudio as sf dataframes:\n\nnetwork &lt;- st_read(dsn=\"data/geospatial\",\n                   layer=\"Punggol_St\")\n\n\nchildcare &lt;- st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\",\n                     layer=\"Punggol_CC\") %&gt;%\n  st_zm(drop = TRUE,\n        what = \"ZM\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\nalways take a look at the data after importing\nuse sf to extract data and save it as a new rds, to avoid re-running data prep steps - this is useful for Take-home Ex01 (sf for geospatial, tidyverse for aspatial)\nspNetwork is different from spatstat - to note that the former has shifted to sf hence input for the former is always in the form of sf\ntidyverse offers lubridate to tidy datetime field\nimporting shp files always need to provide dsn and layer (no need extension)\nfor take-home ex01, to break down folders in “data” file to “rawdata” and “rds” (for derived data) for clarity. all will not be pushed to github as long as “data/” is in .gitignore\nexamining “network” data, linear data must be in LINESTRING, cannot be MULTI-LINESTRING version - if its the latter, have to use st function to break the multi-line into single line, otherwise will have error message\nexamining “childcare” data (from Data.gov, where they convert to kml before converting to shp file hence dimension is XYZ, got Z data vs that of “network” where dimension is XY) however spNetwork can only simple feature hence have to remove z data from “childcare”\n\n\n\nWe can examine the structure of the simple features data tables in RStudio or use the code chunk below to print the content of the network and childcare simple features:\n\nChildcareNetwork\n\n\n\nchildcare\n\n\n\n\nnetwork\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that spNetwork would require the geospatial data to contain complete CRS information.\n\n\nI also double check the EPSG code for both dataframes to ensure that EPSG code is correctly stated as 3414:\n\nst_crs(childcare)\n\n\nst_crs(network)\n\n\n\n\nBefore going into analysis, it is always a good practice to visualise the geospatial data. There are two ways to do so.\nOne way is to use plot() of Base R as shown in the code chunk below:\n\nplot(st_geometry(network))\nplot(childcare,add=T,col='red',pch=19)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\nadd=T means True (short-form)\nthe code above is plotting twice\nimportance of st_geometry: without it, will have more than 1 plot for network (see code below) because “network” has 3 columns - plot(network) will pull out individual columns and plot - so for LINK_ID, colors are mapped to LINK_ID and for ST_NAME, colors are mapped to ST_NAME. st_geometry will hence just pull the geometry (just the road network without the attributes) rather than all columns. does not matter for “childcare” cause you already indicate the color to be the same (red)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(network)\nplot(childcare,add=T,col='red',pch=19)\n\nA second way is to use the mapping function of tmap package to visualise the geospatial data with high cartographic quality and in an interactive manner:\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(childcare)+\n  tm_dots()+\n  tm_shape(network)+\n  tm_lines()\n\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\nCan change the colour of the dots to red to get similar map as above. Define using the extent of the map layer. There are also other symbols that can be used beyond dots (dots vs bubble - former keep size constant when you zoom in and out) (reference):\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(childcare)+\n  tm_dots(col = \"red\")+\n  tm_shape(network)+\n  tm_lines()\n\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\nLeaflet is a lightweight application that allows one to turn on and off the different variables “childcare” and “network”\n\n\n\nCan also toggle between different views\n\n\n\nIf meet with problems rendering, to upgrade tmap\nProf tends to use tmap over plot as it provides more flexibility\nAlways change to plot mode before moving to next section, otherwise it will consume a lot of resources when rendering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will perform NKDE analysis using appropriate functions provided in the spNetwork package.\n\n\nBefore computing NKDE, the Spatial Lines object needs to be cut into lixels with a specified minimal distance. This task can be performed using lixelize_lines() of spNetwork:\n\nlixels &lt;- lixelize_lines(network,\n                         700,\n                         mindist = 350)\n\nIn the code above,\n\nlength of a lixel, lx_length, is set to 700m and\nminimum length of a lixel, mindist, is set to 350m\n\nAfter cutting, if the length of the final lixel is shorter than the minimum distance, it is added to the previous lixel. If NULL, the mindist = maxdist/10. Also note that the segments that are already shorter than the minimum distance are not modified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere is another function called lixelize_lines.mc() which provides multicore support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\nProf set the lixel length at 700m as based on NTU study, 700m is a reasonable walking distance based on Singapore weather while minimum distance was set at 350m by instinct. This is also based on the understanding that parents/grandparents walk their children to the childcare centre.\nat length = 700, mindist = 350, lixels generate 2645 observations while network has 2642 observations.\nfor take-home ex1, need to experiment with different length and mindist cause don’t have context for that.\n\nQuestion: what is the basis for a good cut-off? Prof says calculate the nearest neighbour, test with different distances, plot it out to see which one allows to catch accidents, don’t take a distance that don’t allow you to pick up accidents (cause that would be useless) but also also avoid a distance that captures too many\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, lines_center() of spNetwork will be used to generate a SpatialPointsDataFrame i.e. samples, with line center points as shown in the code chunk below:\n\nsamples &lt;- lines_center(lixels)\n\nThe points are located at the center of the line based on the length of the line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\n“samples” and “lixels” should have the same observations, Prof suggest to plot out\n\n\n\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(lixels) +\n  tm_lines() +\ntm_shape(samples) +\n  tm_dots(size=0.01)\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\n\n\n\n\ndensities &lt;- nkde(network,\n                  events = childcare,\n                  w = rep(1, nrow(childcare)),\n                  samples = samples,\n                  kernel_name = \"quartic\",\n                  bw = 300,\n                  div = \"bw\",\n                  method = \"simple\",\n                  digits = 1,\n                  tol = 1,\n                  grid_shape = c(1,1),\n                  max_depth = 8,\n                  agg = 5,\n                  sparse = TRUE,\n                  verbose = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\nTry not to use kernel_name = “gaussian” method if density tends to negative\noutput from above is a list of numbers (see “densities” below) which will have to be added as a new field under 3.6.3.1 Visualising NKDE:\n\nNote that if want to do the step above, do not sort the data cause the sequence will change and when you map over, will no longer map to the same point.\n\n\n\nUsing the code above gives an error message that the number of columns of arguments do not match. Comparing both dataframes, it is noted that the childcare dataframe contain points that have z coordinates aka points are 3D while network dataframe contain points in 2D format. Based on Details on NKDE, it seems like 2D points are required for the computation and hence an additional step of dropping the z-dimension of points in childcare dataframe is required. This is done using the st_zm() function:\n\nchildcare &lt;- st_zm(childcare)\n\nRerunning the NKDE computation code:\n\ndensities &lt;- nkde(network,\n                  events = childcare,\n                  w = rep(1, nrow(childcare)),\n                  samples = samples,\n                  kernel_name = \"quartic\",\n                  bw = 300,\n                  div = \"bw\",\n                  method = \"simple\",\n                  digits = 1,\n                  tol = 1,\n                  grid_shape = c(1,1),\n                  max_depth = 8,\n                  agg = 5,\n                  sparse = TRUE,\n                  verbose = FALSE)\n\nLearning lessons from the code chunk above:\n\nkernel_name argument indicates that quartic kernel is used. Other possible kernel methods supported by spNetwork are triangle, gaussian, scaled gaussian, tricube, cosine, triweight, epanechnikov or uniform\nmethod argument indicate that simple method is used to calculate the NKDE. At present, spNetwork support three popular methods:\n\nsimple: this method proposes an intuitive solution. The distances between events and sampling points are replaced by network distances, and the formula of the kernel is adapted to calculate the density over a linear unit instead of an area unit.\ndiscontinuous: this method equally divides the mass density of an event at intersections of lixels.\ncontinuous: if the discontinuous method is unbiased, it leads to a discontinuous kernel function which is counter-intuitive. The continuous method divides the mass density at the intersection but adjusts the density before the intersection to make the function continuous.\n\n\n\n\nBefore visualising NKDE values, the code chunk below will be used to insert the computed density values i.e. densities into the samples and lixel objects as density field:\n\nsamples$density &lt;- densities\nlixels$density &lt;- densities\n\nSince the SVY21 projection system is in metres, the computed density values are very small i.e. 0.0000005. The code chunk below is used to rescale the density values from the number of events per metre to number of events per kilometre, to help the mapping:\n\nsamples$density &lt;- samples$density*1000\nlixels$density &lt;- lixels$density*1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\nalways note your unit of measurement\n\n\n\nThe code below then uses appropriate functions of tmap package to prepare interactive and high cartographic quality map visualisation:\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(lixels)+\n  tm_lines(col = \"density\")+\ntm_shape(childcare)+\n  tm_dots()\n\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, complete spatial randomness (CSR) test will be performed using kfunctions() of spNetwork package. The null hypothesis is defined as such:\nH0: The observed spatial point events (i.e. distribution of childcare centres) are uniformly distributed over a street network in Punggol Planning Area.\nThe CSR test is based on the assumption of the binomial point process which implies the hypothesis that the childcare centres are randomly and independently distributed over the street network.\nIf the hypothesis is rejected, we may infer that the distribution of the childcare centres is spatially interacting and dependent on each other and thus, may form non-random patterns.\n\nkfun_childcare &lt;- kfunctions(network,\n                             childcare,\n                             start = 0,\n                             end = 1000,\n                             step = 50,\n                             width = 50,\n                             nsim = 49,\n                             resolution = 50,\n                             verbose = FALSE,\n                             conf_int = 0.05)\n\nLearning points from the code chunk above - there are 10 arguments used in the code chunk:\n\nlines: a SpatialLinesDataFrame with the sampling points. The geometries must be a SpatialLinesDataFrame else it may crash if there are invalid geometries\npoints: a SpatialPointsDataFrame representing the points on the network. These points will be snapped on the network.\nstart: a double, the start value for evaluating K- and G-functions\nend: a double, the last value for evaluating K- and G-functions\nstep: a double, the jump for evaluating the K- and G-functions\nwidth: width of each donut for the G-function\nnsim: indicates the number of Monte Carlo simulations required. Most of the time, more simulations are required for inference\nresolution: when simulating random points on the network, selecting a resolution will greatly reduce the calculation time. When the resolution is null, the random points can occur everywhere on the graph. If a value is specified, the edges are split according to this value and the random points will be selected vertices on the new network.\nconf_int: a double, indicating the width confidence interval (default = 0.05)\n\nThe output of kfunctions() is a list with the following values:\n\nplotkA: ggplot2 object representing the values of the k-function\nplotgA: ggplot2 object representing the values of the g-function\nvaluesA: a dataframe with the values used to build the plots\n\nThe ggplot2 object of k-function can be visualised using the code chunk below:\n\nkfun_childcare$plotk\n\nThe blue line is the empirical network K-function of the childcare centres in Punggol Planning Area. The gray envelope represents the results of the 50 simulations in the interval of 2.5% to 97.5%. As the blue line between the distances of 250m to 400m is below the gray area, we can infer that the childcare centres in Punggol Planning Area resemble regular pattern at the distance of 250m to 400m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\nnote that you can call either plotk or plotg despite the name of the function being kfunctions()\nbefore 250m and after 400m, is complete spatial randomness\nregular pattern occur between 250m to 400m means that childcare centres have a tendency to occur that distance apart within the Punggol area. contrasts with in-class exercise 2/hands-on exercise 2 finding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparameters that enable detection of behavioural or environmental factors can be used to create subset point events i.e. to determine whether caused by people drunk, people ruthless driver or whether it occurred at a junction (these are found within the accident report data)\nextent to note that its Bangkok Metropolitan Region (to select out the 6 regions that define the boundary) - note from the Wikipedia page and extract from Thailand - Subnational Administrative Boundaries on HDX (do not use the OpenStreetMap version as its much larger, more data)\nto note to categorise data to “rawdata” and “rds”\nstart the file by going to Quarto Document –&gt; create Take-home_Ex01"

Prof says calculate the nearest neighbour, test with different distances, plot it out to see which one allows to catch accidents, don’t take a distance that don’t allow you to pick up accidents (cause that would be useless) but also also avoid a distance that captures too many\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, lines_center() of spNetwork will be used to generate a SpatialPointsDataFrame i.e. samples, with line center points as shown in the code chunk below:\n\nsamples &lt;- lines_center(lixels)\n\nThe points are located at the center of the line based on the length of the line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\n“samples” and “lixels” should have the same observations, Prof suggest to plot out\n\n\n\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(lixels) +\n  tm_lines() +\ntm_shape(samples) +\n  tm_dots(size=0.01)\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\n\n\n\n\ndensities &lt;- nkde(network,\n                  events = childcare,\n                  w = rep(1, nrow(childcare)),\n                  samples = samples,\n                  kernel_name = \"quartic\",\n                  bw = 300,\n                  div = \"bw\",\n                  method = \"simple\",\n                  digits = 1,\n                  tol = 1,\n                  grid_shape = c(1,1),\n                  max_depth = 8,\n                  agg = 5,\n                  sparse = TRUE,\n                  verbose = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\nTry not to use kernel_name = “gaussian” method if density tends to negative\noutput from above is a list of numbers (see “densities” below) which will have to be added as a new field under 3.6.3.1 Visualising NKDE:\n\nNote that if want to do the step above, do not sort the data cause the sequence will change and when you map over, will no longer map to the same point.\n\n\n\nUsing the code above gives an error message that the number of columns of arguments do not match. Comparing both dataframes, it is noted that the childcare dataframe contain points that have z coordinates aka points are 3D while network dataframe contain points in 2D format. Based on Details on NKDE, it seems like 2D points are required for the computation and hence an additional step of dropping the z-dimension of points in childcare dataframe is required. This is done using the st_zm() function:\n\nchildcare &lt;- st_zm(childcare)\n\nRerunning the NKDE computation code:\n\ndensities &lt;- nkde(network,\n                  events = childcare,\n                  w = rep(1, nrow(childcare)),\n                  samples = samples,\n                  kernel_name = \"quartic\",\n                  bw = 300,\n                  div = \"bw\",\n                  method = \"simple\",\n                  digits = 1,\n                  tol = 1,\n                  grid_shape = c(1,1),\n                  max_depth = 8,\n                  agg = 5,\n                  sparse = TRUE,\n                  verbose = FALSE)\n\nLearning lessons from the code chunk above:\n\nkernel_name argument indicates that quartic kernel is used. Other possible kernel methods supported by spNetwork are triangle, gaussian, scaled gaussian, tricube, cosine, triweight, epanechnikov or uniform\nmethod argument indicate that simple method is used to calculate the NKDE. At present, spNetwork support three popular methods:\n\nsimple: this method proposes an intuitive solution. The distances between events and sampling points are replaced by network distances, and the formula of the kernel is adapted to calculate the density over a linear unit instead of an area unit.\ndiscontinuous: this method equally divides the mass density of an event at intersections of lixels.\ncontinuous: if the discontinuous method is unbiased, it leads to a discontinuous kernel function which is counter-intuitive. The continuous method divides the mass density at the intersection but adjusts the density before the intersection to make the function continuous.\n\n\n\n\nBefore visualising NKDE values, the code chunk below will be used to insert the computed density values i.e. densities into the samples and lixel objects as density field:\n\nsamples$density &lt;- densities\nlixels$density &lt;- densities\n\nSince the SVY21 projection system is in metres, the computed density values are very small i.e. 0.0000005. The code chunk below is used to rescale the density values from the number of events per metre to number of events per kilometre, to help the mapping:\n\nsamples$density &lt;- samples$density*1000\nlixels$density &lt;- lixels$density*1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\nalways note your unit of measurement\n\n\n\nThe code below then uses appropriate functions of tmap package to prepare interactive and high cartographic quality map visualisation:\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(lixels)+\n  tm_lines(col = \"density\")+\ntm_shape(childcare)+\n  tm_dots()\n\n\ntmap_mode('plot')"

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\n\n\n\noptions(timeout = 2000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), road traffic accidents cause the death of approximately 1.19 million people each year and leave between 20 to 50 million people with non-fatal injuries. Vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists, make up more than half of all road traffic deaths.\nRoad traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5 to 29, however two-thirds of road traffic fatalities occur among people of working ages, from 18 to 59 years. Further, nine in 10 fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these countries make up only around 60% of the world’s vehicles.\nBesides human suffering, road traffic injuries also result in a heavy economic burden on victims and their families, through treatment costs for the injured and loss of productivity of those killed or disabled. More broadly, road traffic injuries have a serious impact on national economies, costing countries 3% of their annual gross domestic product.\nAccording to the WHO, Thailand’s roads are the deadliest in Southeast Asia and among the worst in the world - about 20,000 people die in road accidents each year, or about 56 deaths a day.\nBetween 2014 and 2021, Thailand experienced a notable increase in accident frequencies. Specifically, 19% of all accidents in Thailand occurred on the national highways, which make up the primary public thoroughfares connecting various regions, provinces, districts, and significant locations within a comprehensive network. Within the broader context of accidents across the country, there existed a considerable 66% likelihood of encountering accident-prone zones, often termed as ‘black spots’ which are distributed as follows: 66% on straight road segments, 13% at curves, 6% at median points of cross-shaped intersections, 5% at T-shaped intersections and Y-shaped intersections, 3% at cross-shaped intersections, 2% on bridges, and 2% on steep slopes.\n\n\n\nBy and large, road traffic accidents can be attributed by two major factors, namely behavioural and environmental factors.\n\nBehavioural factors in driving are considered to be major causes of traffic accidents either in direct or indirect manner (Lewin, 1982). These factors can be further grouped into driver behavior (driver/driving style) and driver performance (driver/driving skills) (Elander, West, & French, 1993).\nEnvironmental factors, on the other hand, includes but not limited to weather conditions such as poor visibility during heavy rain or fogs as well as road conditions such as sharp bends, slippery slopes, and blind spots.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated the significant potential of Spatial Point Patterns Analysis (SPPA) in exploring and identifying factors influencing road traffic accidents. However, these studies often focus solely on either behavioral or environmental factors, with limited consideration of temporal factors such as season, day of the week, or time of day.\nIn view of this, in this hands-on exercise, we will determine factors that affect road traffic accidents in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) by employing both spatial and spatio-temporal point patterns analysis methods.\nThe specific objectives are as follows:\n\nTo visualize the spatio-temporal dynamics of road traffic accidents in BMR using appropriate statistical graphics and geovisualization methods.\nTo conduct detailed spatial analysis of road traffic accidents using appropriate Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods.\nTo conduct detailed spatio-temporal analysis of road traffic accidents using appropriate Temporal Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods.\n\n\n\n\nKey packages that are installed are:\n\nsf for importing, managing, and processing vector-based geospatial data, and\nspatstat, which has a wide range of useful functions for point pattern analysis. In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to perform 1st- and 2nd-order spatial point patterns analysis and derive kernel density estimation (KDE) layer\nraster which reads, writes, manipulates, analyses and model of gridded spatial data (i.e. raster). In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to convert image output generate by spatstat into raster format.\nmaptools which provides a set of tools for manipulating geographic data. In this hands-on exercise, we mainly use it to convert Spatial objects into ppp format of spatstat.\ntmap which provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps by using leaflet API.\ntidyverse for performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling and visualising data.\nspNetwork which provides functions to perform Spatial Point Patterns Analysis such as kernel density estimation (KDE) and K-function on network. It can also be used to build spatial matrices (`listw’ objects like in ‘spdep’ package) to conduct any kind of traditional spatial analysis with spatial weights based on reticular distances.\n\nThe packages are loaded with the following code chunk:\n\npacman::p_load(sf,spatstat,raster,maptools,tmap,tidyverse,spNetwork,DT,forcats,ggthemes,plotly)\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, three basic data sets are used:\n\nThailand Road Accident [2019-2022] on Kaggle - comprised records of road accidents in Thailand from ~2019 to 2022, based on information provided by the Office of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transport.\nThailand - Subnational Administrative Boundaries on HDX\nThailand Roads (OpenStreetMap Export) on HDX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data is imported using the code below:\n\nroadacc &lt;- read_csv(\"data/rawdata/thai_road_accident_2019_2022.csv\")\n\nTaking a glimpse at the data to determine the fields in the data:\n\nglimpse(roadacc)\n\nRows: 81,735\nColumns: 18\n$ acc_code                    &lt;dbl&gt; 571905, 3790870, 599075, 571924, 599523, 5…\n$ incident_datetime           &lt;dttm&gt; 2019-01-01 00:00:00, 2019-01-01 00:03:00,…\n$ report_datetime             &lt;dttm&gt; 2019-01-02 06:11:00, 2020-02-20 13:48:00,…\n$ province_th                 &lt;chr&gt; \"ลพบุรี\", \"อุบลราชธานี\", \"ประจวบคีรีขันธ์\", \"เชียงใ…\n$ province_en                 &lt;chr&gt; \"Loburi\", \"Ubon Ratchathani\", \"Prachuap Kh…\n$ agency                      &lt;chr&gt; \"department of rural roads\", \"department o…\n$ route                       &lt;chr&gt; \"แยกทางหลวงหมายเลข 21 (กม.ที่ 31+000) - บ้านวั…\n$ vehicle_type                &lt;chr&gt; \"motorcycle\", \"private/passenger car\", \"mo…\n$ presumed_cause              &lt;chr&gt; \"driving under the influence of alcohol\", …\n$ accident_type               &lt;chr&gt; \"other\", \"rollover/fallen on straight road…\n$ number_of_vehicles_involved &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n$ number_of_fatalities        &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, …\n$ number_of_injuries          &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, …\n$ weather_condition           &lt;chr&gt; \"clear\", \"clear\", \"clear\", \"clear\", \"clear…\n$ latitude                    &lt;dbl&gt; 14.959105, 15.210738, 12.374259, 18.601721…\n$ longitude                   &lt;dbl&gt; 100.87346, 104.86269, 99.90795, 98.80420, …\n$ road_description            &lt;chr&gt; \"straight road\", \"straight road\", \"wide cu…\n$ slope_description           &lt;chr&gt; \"no slope\", \"no slope\", \"slope area\", \"no …\n\n\nThere are 81735 rows and 18 variables.

will first drop “province_th” as it indicates the provinces in the Thai language.\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc[, !names(roadacc) %in% c(\"province_th\",\"route\")]\n\n\n\n\nWe then determine the unique provinces within the dataset and scan through the province names (i.e. in case there are any entries that refer to the same province but are spelt differently/have spelling mistakes) before filtering the data to just include provinces that are within the BMR:\n\nunique_provinces &lt;- roadacc %&gt;% \n  distinct(province_en) %&gt;%\n  arrange(province_en)\n\nDT::datatable(unique_provinces,class =

\n  filter(province_en %in% c(\"Bangkok\", \"Nakhon Pathom\", \"Nonthaburi\", \"Pathum Thani\",\"Samut Prakan\",\"Samut Sakhon\"))\n\nThis leaves the data with 13336 rows.\n\n\n\nWe further clean the data by removing rows with missing data:\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  drop_na()\n\n\n\n\nWe also check if there are duplicate entries in the dataset:\n\nroadacc$acc_code[duplicated(roadacc$acc_code) == TRUE]\n\nnumeric(0)\n\n\nThere are no duplicate entries.\nGenerating summary statistics of roadacc:\n\nsummary(roadacc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\nDuring class, Prof Kam had advised to study the data carefully and shared that it was important to filter out data with incomplete coordinates (missing either longitude or latitude or both) and shared that one way to do it was via the code below:\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(longitude) & longitude != \"\",\n         !is.na(latitude) & latitude != \"\")\n\nAs with the drop_na() code above, this way will also leave just 12986 rows of data as the missing data were found in either the longitude or latitude variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe convert roadacc data frame into a simple feature data frame and also transform the data from geographic coordinate system (EPSG: 4326 WGS84 Geographic Coordinate

While there are 2 possible projected coordinate systems for Thailand, EPSG 32647 and 32648, the appropriate projected coordinate system to transform the data to would be EPSG 32647 as the minimum and maximum longitude of roadacc falls within EPSG 32467’s area of use (between 96°E and 102°E). A comparison of the area of use for both projected coordinate systems is shown below:\n\n\n\n\nEPSG 32647\nEPSG 32648\n\n\n\n\nArea of use\nBetween 96°E and 102°E, northern hemisphere between equator and 84°N, onshore and offshore.

Looking at the summary statistics below, there are data entries that could have been erroneously recorded resulting in a negative time gap between report time and incident time (i.e. report time was earlier than incident time). As such, the data was further filtered to remove erroneous data to avoid affecting the analysis:\n\nsummary(roadacc$timegap)\n\n     Min.   1st Qu.    Median      Mean   3rd Qu.

Once the file is saved, we can add “#| eval: false” to the data cleaning and wrangling codes to avoid re-running them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data has different files providing details of the administrative boundaries of Thailand at different administrative levels:\n\nLevel 0 (country)\nLevel 1 (province)\nLevel 2 (district)\nLevel 3 (sub-district, tambon)\n\nAs our area of interest is at Level 1 (province level), we will utilise “tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121” that reflects details at province levels and import the data using the code chunk below:\n\nprovincedata = st_read(dsn = \"data/rawdata\", \n                  layer = \"tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121\")\n\nWe note from the above that it is a multipolygon feature data frame. We note that there are 77 features and 16 fields, and the data is in WGS84 geographic coordinate system.\nWe then take a glimpse of the data:\n\nglimpse(provincedata)\n\n\n\n\nWe note from a glimpse of the data above that there are only a few pertinent fields that we require for our analysis, specifically:\n\nADM1_EN: province name in english\nShape_Leng\nShape_Area\ngeometry\n\nWe hence filter the data to only comprise these fields to make the data frame more manageable:\n\nprovincedata &lt;- provincedata %&gt;%\n  select(\"ADM1_EN\", \"Shape_Leng\",\"Shape_Area\",\"geometry\")\n\n\n\n\nWe also filter to keep only data that are relevant to our area of interest which is BMR:\n\nprovincedata &lt;- provincedata %&gt;% \n  filter(ADM1_EN %in% c(\"Bangkok\", \"Nakhon Pathom\", \"Nonthaburi\", \"Pathum Thani\",\"Samut Prakan\",\"Samut Sakhon\"))\n\nThis leaves 6 rows of data and 4 variables.\n\n\n\nFrom the code chunk below, it is noted that the EPSG code for the selectedboundaries data frame is EPSG: 4326:\n\nst_crs(provincedata)\n\nWe will need to reproject provincedata from EPSG code to EPSG: 32647 which is the projected coordinate system to use for BMR, our area of interest:\n\nprovincedata32647 &lt;- st_transform(provincedata, \n                              crs = 32647)\n\nWe check if the EPSG code has been correctly assigned:\n\nst_crs(provincedata32647)\n\n\n\n\nWe save this cleaned data as a rds file:\n\nwrite_rds(provincedata32647,\"data/rds/provincedata32647.rds\")\n\n\nprovincedata32647 &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/provincedata32647.rds\")\n\nWe visualise our provincedata32647:\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(provincedata32647)+\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\n\n\n\nWe import the data as follows:\n\nroadlines = st_read(dsn = \"data/rawdata\",\n                    layer = \"hotosm_tha_roads_lines_shp\")\n\nWe then glimpse at the data:\n\nglimpse(roadlines)\n\n\nst_geometry(roadlines)\n\nThe dataset is very large, with 2792590 rows and 15 variables but we only need to extract relevant information that lie within the BMR for analysis.\n\n\n\nBased on the code chunk below, it is noted that the coordinate system of the roadlines data is missing.\n\nst_crs(roadlines)\n\nBased on the values of the geometry in roadlines, the coordinates seem to be in geographic (latitude/longitude) form, in degrees, typically in a CRS like EPSG:4326 (WGS 84) used for global geographic coordinates. We hence assign the missing EPSG code using the code chunk below:\n\nroadlines4326 &lt;- st_set_crs(roadlines,4326)\n\nWe check the CRS using the code chunk below:\n\nst_crs(roadlines4326)\n\nFor analysis, we would eventually need to overlay the roadlines4326 data with the selectedboundaries32647 data to determine the roads that lie within BMR. In order to perform geoprocessing using two geospatial data, both geospatial data would need to be projected using similar coordinate systems - in this case, it its EPSG: 32647:\n\nroadlines32647 &lt;- st_transform(roadlines4326, \n                              crs = 32647)\n\nWe check the CRS code again:\n\nst_crs(roadlines32647)\n\n\n\n\nBased on the columns in the data frame roadlines32647, the columns that seem relevant/useful to retain for analysis are “highway”, “surface”, “smoothness”, “width”, “lanes”, “oneway”, “bridge” and “geometry”.\nHowever before going ahead to retain these variables, we determine the presence of missing data within roadlines32647:\n\nmissing_counts &lt;- sapply(roadlines32647, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))\nprint(missing_counts)\n\nBased on the result above, more than 60% of data is missing for the variable “source” and more than 80% of data is missing for the variables “name”, “name_en”, “surface”, “smoothness”, “width”, “lanes”, “oneway”, “bridge”, “layer”, “source” and “name_th”. Given the extent of missing data, we will omit these columns as they would not provide useful information for analysis and only retain the relevant/useful columns “highway” and “geometry” with no missing data:\n\nselectedroadlines &lt;- roadlines32647 %&gt;%\n  select(\"highway\", \"geometry\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below is used to determine the types of highways in the selectedroadlines data frame:\n\nunique_highway &lt;- unique(selectedroadlines$highway)\nunique_highway &lt;- sort(unique_highway)\n\nunique_highway\n\nTo determine which classes of highway to retain for analysis, the default access restrictions based on the interpretation of Thailand’s Road Traffic Act, 1979 was referenced (source):\n\nA detailed explanation on the type of highways and whether they are included for analysis is indicated in the table below:\n\n\n\nTypes of highway\nDetails\nIncluded for analysis?\n\n\n\n\nabandoned\nUnused/Abandoned roads that are only passable on foot/two-wheel vehicles\nNo\n\n\nbarrier\nRoadside barriers used to protect traffic from roadside obstacles or hazards (source)\nNo\n\n\nbridleway\nA bridle path, also bridleway, equestrian trail, horse riding path, ride, bridle road, or horse trail, is a trail or a thoroughfare that is used by people riding on horses.

Based on the plot below, it can be seen that there is still too much data causing overcrowding of the map.\n\nplot(st_geometry(roadsbkkinterim))\n\nWe first plot the distribution of classes of highway in the roadsbkkinterim dataset:\n\nroad_counts &lt;- roadsbkkinterim %&gt;%\n  count(highway) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100)\n\nggplot(road_counts, aes(x = fct_reorder(highway, n))) + \n  geom_bar(aes(y = n), stat = \"identity\", fill = \"lightyellow\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage, 1), \"%\"), y = n + 0.5),\n            vjust = 0,\n            size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of classes of highways\", x = \"Class of Highway\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above, it is noted that service and residential highways make up 47.9% and 44.7% of the total road lines in the dataset. Beyond the information provided in the table above on highway details, we note the following about the service and residential highways:\n\nservice: denotes ways used for vehicle access to a building, parking lot, service station, business estate, beach, campsite etc. they are usually not part of the public street network and may be inaccessible to the general public (source)\nresidential: roads are typically short in length and likely to have lower speed limits and traffic calming measures in place (source)\n\nGiven the limited scale (in terms of size and potential impact to the general population) and that the sheer volume of the service and residential roads could overcrowd the other road lines in the data, we will omit them from our analysis:\nDropping service and residential highways:\n\nroadsbkk &lt;- roadsbkkinterim %&gt;%\n  filter(!(highway %in% c(\"service\",\"residential\")))\n\nWe then take a quick look at the geometry - while there are still a lot of data lines, the plot has cleaned up slightly and we will proceed with this data for now:\n\nplot(st_geometry(roadsbkk))\n\n\n\n\nWe then check the geometry of roadsbkk:\n\ngeometry_types &lt;- roadsbkk %&gt;%\n  st_geometry_type() %&gt;%\n  as.character() %&gt;%\n  unique()\n\ngeometry_types\n\nAs seen from the output above, the roadsbkk data comprises both linestring and multilinestring geometries.

In spatstat, an object called owin is specially designed to represent this polygonal region. The code chunk below is used to covert provincedata32647 SpatialPolygon object into owin object of spatstat:\n\nprovinceowin &lt;- as.owin(provincedata32647)\n\nThe ouput object can be displayed by using plot() function\n\nplot(provinceowin)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary(provinceowin)\n\nWindow: polygonal boundary\nsingle connected closed polygon with 13779 vertices\nenclosing rectangle: [587893.5, 712440.5] x [1484413.7, 1579076.3] units\n                     (124500 x 94660 units)\nWindow area = 7668990000 square units\nFraction of frame area: 0.65\n\n\n\n\n\nWe extract road accident events that are located within the BMR by using the code chunk below:\n\nroadacc_owin_ppp = roadacc_ppp[provinceowin]\n\n\nplot(roadacc_owin_ppp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary(roadacc_owin_ppp)\n\nMarked planar point pattern:  12985 points\nAverage intensity 1.693182e-06 points per square unit\n\nCoordinates are given to 10 decimal places\n\nmarks are numeric, of type 'double'\nSummary:\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Adaptive schemes adjust itself according to the density of data - shorter bandwidths are used where data are dense and longer where sparse. This helps to mitigate against highly skewed distribution of spatial point patterns.\nHowever, before we do so, we convert the unit of measurement to kilometer as the default unit of measurement of

    "text": "According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), road traffic accidents cause the death of approximately 1.19 million people each year and leave between 20 to 50 million people with non-fatal injuries. Vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists, make up more than half of all road traffic deaths.\nRoad traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5 to 29, however two-thirds of road traffic fatalities occur among people of working ages, from 18 to 59 years. Further, nine in 10 fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these countries make up only around 60% of the world’s vehicles.\nBesides human suffering, road traffic injuries also result in a heavy economic burden on victims and their families, through treatment costs for the injured and loss of productivity of those killed or disabled. More broadly, road traffic injuries have a serious impact on national economies, costing countries 3% of their annual gross domestic product.\nAccording to the WHO, Thailand’s roads are the deadliest in Southeast Asia and among the worst in the world - about 20,000 people die in road accidents each year, or about 56 deaths a day.\nBetween 2014 and 2021, Thailand experienced a notable increase in accident frequencies. Specifically, 19% of all accidents in Thailand occurred on the national highways, which make up the primary public thoroughfares connecting various regions, provinces, districts, and significant locations within a comprehensive network. Within the broader context of accidents across the country, there existed a considerable 66% likelihood of encountering accident-prone zones, often termed as ‘black spots’ which are distributed as follows: 66% on straight road segments, 13% at curves, 6% at median points of cross-shaped intersections, 5% at T-shaped intersections and Y-shaped intersections, 3% at cross-shaped intersections, 2% on bridges, and 2% on steep slopes."

    "text": "By and large, road traffic accidents can be attributed by two major factors, namely behavioural and environmental factors.\n\nBehavioural factors in driving are considered to be major causes of traffic accidents either in direct or indirect manner (Lewin, 1982). These factors can be further grouped into driver behavior (driver/driving style) and driver performance (driver/driving skills) (Elander, West, & French, 1993).\nEnvironmental factors, on the other hand, includes but not limited to weather conditions such as poor visibility during heavy rain or fogs as well as road conditions such as sharp bends, slippery slopes, and blind spots.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated the significant potential of Spatial Point Patterns Analysis (SPPA) in exploring and identifying factors influencing road traffic accidents. However, these studies often focus solely on either behavioral or environmental factors, with limited consideration of temporal factors such as season, day of the week, or time of day.\nIn view of this, in this hands-on exercise, we will determine factors that affect road traffic accidents in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) by employing both spatial and spatio-temporal point patterns analysis methods.\nThe specific objectives are as follows:\n\nTo visualize the spatio-temporal dynamics of road traffic accidents in BMR using appropriate statistical graphics and geovisualization methods.\nTo conduct detailed spatial analysis of road traffic accidents using appropriate Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods.\nTo conduct detailed spatio-temporal analysis of road traffic accidents using appropriate Temporal Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods."

will first drop “province_th” as it indicates the provinces in the Thai language.\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc[, !names(roadacc) %in% c(\"province_th\",\"route\")]\n\n\n\n\nWe then determine the unique provinces within the dataset and scan through the province names (i.e. in case there are any entries that refer to the same province but are spelt differently/have spelling mistakes) before filtering the data to just include provinces that are within the BMR:\n\nunique_provinces &lt;- roadacc %&gt;% \n  distinct(province_en) %&gt;%\n  arrange(province_en)\n\nDT::datatable(unique_provinces,class = \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\nOur region of interest comprises Bangkok and five adjacent provinces of Nakhon Pathom, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, Samut Prakan and Samut Sakhon.\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;% \n  filter(province_en %in% c(\"Bangkok\", \"Nakhon Pathom\", \"Nonthaburi\", \"Pathum Thani\",\"Samut Prakan\",\"Samut Sakhon\"))\n\nThis leaves the data with 13336 rows.\n\n\n\nWe further clean the data by removing rows with missing data:\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  drop_na()\n\n\n\n\nWe also check if there are duplicate entries in the dataset:\n\nroadacc$acc_code[duplicated(roadacc$acc_code) == TRUE]\n\nnumeric(0)\n\n\nThere are no duplicate entries.\nGenerating summary statistics of roadacc:\n\nsummary(roadacc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\nDuring class, Prof Kam had advised to study the data carefully and shared that it was important to filter out data with incomplete coordinates (missing either longitude or latitude or both) and shared that one way to do it was via the code below:\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(longitude) & longitude != \"\",\n         !is.na(latitude) & latitude != \"\")\n\nAs with the drop_na() code above, this way will also leave just 12986 rows of data as the missing data were found in either the longitude or latitude variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe convert roadacc data frame into a simple feature data frame and also transform the data from geographic coordinate system (EPSG: 4326 WGS84 Geographic Coordinate System) to projected coordinate system:\n\nroadacc &lt;- st_as_sf(roadacc, \n                    coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"),\n                    crs=4326) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs = 32647)\n\nBased on the summary statistics of roadacc above, it is noted that the minimum longitude is 99.85° and maximum longitude is 100.94°. While there are 2 possible projected coordinate systems for Thailand, EPSG 32647 and 32648, the appropriate projected coordinate system to transform the data to would be EPSG 32647 as the minimum and maximum longitude of roadacc falls within EPSG 32467’s area of use (between 96°E and 102°E). A comparison of the area of use for both projected coordinate systems is shown below:\n\n\n\n\nEPSG 32647\nEPSG 32648\n\n\n\n\nArea of use\nBetween 96°E and 102°E, northern hemisphere between equator and 84°N, onshore and offshore. China. Indonesia. Laos. Malaysia - West Malaysia. Mongolia. Myanmar (Burma). Russian Federation. Thailand.\nBetween 102°E and 108°E, northern hemisphere between equator and 84°N, onshore and offshore. Cambodia. China. Indonesia. Laos. Malaysia - West Malaysia. Mongolia. Russian Federation. Singapore. Thailand. Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe incident_datetime and report_datetime variables are in datetime field, we hence utilise these variables and the lubridate() function to generate new variables that represent:\n\nmonth: “inc_month”\nday of week: “inc_dayofweek”\ntime of day: “inc_time”\n\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  mutate(inc_year = year(incident_datetime)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(inc_month = month(incident_datetime,\n                       label = TRUE,\n                       abbr = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(inc_dayofweek = wday(incident_datetime,\n                              week_start = getOption(\"lubridate.week.start\", 1),\n                              label = TRUE,\n                              abbr = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(inc_time = hour(incident_datetime))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\nNote that we can generate month in numbers or in factor format via:\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month_num = month(incident_datetime)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month_fac = month(incident_datetime,\n                       label = TRUE,\n                       abbr = TRUE))\n\n\n\nWe also determine the gap between the incident time and reporting time and create a new variable “timegap” in hours unit:\n\nroadacc$timegap &lt;- time_length(roadacc$report_datetime - roadacc$incident_datetime, \"hours\")\n\nLogically, the date and time when the accident was reported should be after the date and time of the accident occurrence. Looking at the summary statistics below, there are data entries that could have been erroneously recorded resulting in a negative time gap between report time and incident time (i.e. report time was earlier than incident time). As such, the data was further filtered to remove erroneous data to avoid affecting the analysis:\n\nsummary(roadacc$timegap)\n\n     Min.   1st Qu.    Median      Mean   3rd Qu.

Once the file is saved, we can add “#| eval: false” to the data cleaning and wrangling codes to avoid re-running them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data has different files providing details of the administrative boundaries of Thailand at different administrative levels:\n\nLevel 0 (country)\nLevel 1 (province)\nLevel 2 (district)\nLevel 3 (sub-district, tambon)\n\nAs our area of interest is at Level 1 (province level), we will utilise “tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121” that reflects details at province levels and import the data using the code chunk below:\n\nprovincedata = st_read(dsn = \"data/rawdata\", \n                  layer = \"tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121\")\n\nWe note from the above that it is a multipolygon feature data frame. We note that there are 77 features and 16 fields, and the data is in WGS84 geographic coordinate system.\nWe then take a glimpse of the data:\n\nglimpse(provincedata)\n\n\n\n\nWe note from a glimpse of the data above that there are only a few pertinent fields that we require for our analysis, specifically:\n\nADM1_EN: province name in english\nShape_Leng\nShape_Area\ngeometry\n\nWe hence filter the data to only comprise these fields to make the data frame more manageable:\n\nprovincedata &lt;- provincedata %&gt;%\n  select(\"ADM1_EN\", \"Shape_Leng\",\"Shape_Area\",\"geometry\")\n\n\n\n\nWe also filter to keep only data that are relevant to our area of interest which is BMR:\n\nprovincedata &lt;- provincedata %&gt;% \n  filter(ADM1_EN %in% c(\"Bangkok\", \"Nakhon Pathom\", \"Nonthaburi\", \"Pathum Thani\",\"Samut Prakan\",\"Samut Sakhon\"))\n\nThis leaves 6 rows of data and 4 variables.\n\n\n\nFrom the code chunk below, it is noted that the EPSG code for the selectedboundaries data frame is EPSG: 4326:\n\nst_crs(provincedata)\n\nWe will need to reproject provincedata from EPSG code to EPSG: 32647 which is the projected coordinate system to use for BMR, our area of interest:\n\nprovincedata32647 &lt;- st_transform(provincedata, \n                              crs = 32647)\n\nWe check if the EPSG code has been correctly assigned:\n\nst_crs(provincedata32647)\n\n\n\n\nWe save this cleaned data as a rds file:\n\nwrite_rds(provincedata32647,\"data/rds/provincedata32647.rds\")\n\n\nprovincedata32647 &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/provincedata32647.rds\")\n\nWe visualise our provincedata32647:\n\ntmap_mode('view')\ntm_shape(provincedata32647)+\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\n\n\n\n\nWe import the data as follows:\n\nroadlines = st_read(dsn = \"data/rawdata\",\n                    layer = \"hotosm_tha_roads_lines_shp\")\n\nWe then glimpse at the data:\n\nglimpse(roadlines)\n\n\nst_geometry(roadlines)\n\nThe dataset is very large, with 2792590 rows and 15 variables but we only need to extract relevant information that lie within the BMR for analysis.\n\n\n\nBased on the code chunk below, it is noted that the coordinate system of the roadlines data is missing.\n\nst_crs(roadlines)\n\nBased on the values of the geometry in roadlines, the coordinates seem to be in geographic (latitude/longitude) form, in degrees, typically in a CRS like EPSG:4326 (WGS 84) used for global geographic coordinates. We hence assign the missing EPSG code using the code chunk below:\n\nroadlines4326 &lt;- st_set_crs(roadlines,4326)\n\nWe check the CRS using the code chunk below:\n\nst_crs(roadlines4326)\n\nFor analysis, we would eventually need to overlay the roadlines4326 data with the selectedboundaries32647 data to determine the roads that lie within BMR. In order to perform geoprocessing using two geospatial data, both geospatial data would need to be projected using similar coordinate systems - in this case, it its EPSG: 32647:\n\nroadlines32647 &lt;- st_transform(roadlines4326, \n                              crs = 32647)\n\nWe check the CRS code again:\n\nst_crs(roadlines32647)\n\n\n\n\nBased on the columns in the data frame roadlines32647, the columns that seem relevant/useful to retain for analysis are “highway”, “surface”, “smoothness”, “width”, “lanes”, “oneway”, “bridge” and “geometry”.\nHowever before going ahead to retain these variables, we determine the presence of missing data within roadlines32647:\n\nmissing_counts &lt;- sapply(roadlines32647, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))\nprint(missing_counts)\n\nBased on the result above, more than 60% of data is missing for the variable “source” and more than 80% of data is missing for the variables “name”, “name_en”, “surface”, “smoothness”, “width”, “lanes”, “oneway”, “bridge”, “layer”, “source” and “name_th”. Given the extent of missing data, we will omit these columns as they would not provide useful information for analysis and only retain the relevant/useful columns “highway” and “geometry” with no missing data:\n\nselectedroadlines &lt;- roadlines32647 %&gt;%\n  select(\"highway\", \"geometry\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below is used to determine the types of highways in the selectedroadlines data frame:\n\nunique_highway &lt;- unique(selectedroadlines$highway)\nunique_highway &lt;- sort(unique_highway)\n\nunique_highway\n\nTo determine which classes of highway to retain for analysis, the default access restrictions based on the interpretation of Thailand’s Road Traffic Act, 1979 was referenced (source):\n\nA detailed explanation on the type of highways and whether they are included for analysis is indicated in the table below:\n\n\n\nTypes of highway\nDetails\nIncluded for analysis?\n\n\n\n\nabandoned\nUnused/Abandoned roads that are only passable on foot/two-wheel vehicles\nNo\n\n\nbarrier\nRoadside barriers used to protect traffic from roadside obstacles or hazards (source)\nNo\n\n\nbridleway\nA bridle path, also bridleway, equestrian trail, horse riding path, ride, bridle road, or horse trail, is a trail or a thoroughfare that is used by people riding on horses.

Based on the plot below, it can be seen that there is still too much data causing overcrowding of the map.\n\nplot(st_geometry(roadsbkkinterim))\n\nWe first plot the distribution of classes of highway in the roadsbkkinterim dataset:\n\nroad_counts &lt;- roadsbkkinterim %&gt;%\n  count(highway) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100)\n\nggplot(road_counts, aes(x = fct_reorder(highway, n))) + \n  geom_bar(aes(y = n), stat = \"identity\", fill = \"lightyellow\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage, 1), \"%\"), y = n + 0.5),\n            vjust = 0,\n            size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of classes of highways\", x = \"Class of Highway\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above, it is noted that service and residential highways make up 47.9% and 44.7% of the total road lines in the dataset. Beyond the information provided in the table above on highway details, we note the following about the service and residential highways:\n\nservice: denotes ways used for vehicle access to a building, parking lot, service station, business estate, beach, campsite etc. they are usually not part of the public street network and may be inaccessible to the general public (source)\nresidential: roads are typically short in length and likely to have lower speed limits and traffic calming measures in place (source)\n\nGiven the limited scale (in terms of size and potential impact to the general population) and that the sheer volume of the service and residential roads could overcrowd the other road lines in the data, we will omit them from our analysis:\nDropping service and residential highways:\n\nroadsbkk &lt;- roadsbkkinterim %&gt;%\n  filter(!(highway %in% c(\"service\",\"residential\")))\n\nWe then take a quick look at the geometry - while there are still a lot of data lines, the plot has cleaned up slightly and we will proceed with this data for now:\n\nplot(st_geometry(roadsbkk))\n\n\n\n\nWe then check the geometry of roadsbkk:\n\ngeometry_types &lt;- roadsbkk %&gt;%\n  st_geometry_type() %&gt;%\n  as.character() %&gt;%\n  unique()\n\ngeometry_types\n\nAs seen from the output above, the roadsbkk data comprises both linestring and multilinestring geometries. Linestring represents a single line, while MultiLinestring represents a collection of multiple lines. We need to simplify the data structure by converting multilinestring to linestring geometry to facilitate downstream analysis as the use of multilinestring might lead to error.\nWe utilise the st_cast() function to break down multilinestring geometries to linestring geometries:\n\nroadsbkk &lt;- st_cast(roadsbkk,\"LINESTRING\",group_or_split = TRUE)\n\nWe double check the geometry types and note from the output below that the geometry is now just linestring:\n\ngeometry_types &lt;- roadsbkk %&gt;%\n  st_geometry_type() %&gt;%\n  as.character() %&gt;%\n  unique()\n\ngeometry_types\n\n\n\n\nWe save this cleaned data as a rds file:\n\nwrite_rds(roadsbkk,\"data/rds/roadsbkk.rds\")\n\n\nroadsbkk &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/roadsbkk.rds\")"

By the end to this hands-on exercise, the aim is to be able to:\n\nimport geospatial data using appropriate function(s) of sf package,\nimport csv file using appropriate function of readr package,\nperform relational join using appropriate join function of dplyr package,\ncompute spatial weights using appropriate functions of spdep package, and\ncalculate spatially lagged variables using appropriate functions of spdep package.\n\n\n\n\nTwo data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise:\n\nHunan county boundary layer.

The most connected region has 11 neighbours. There are two regions with only one neighbour.\nFor each polygon in the polygon object, wm_q lists all neighboring polygons. For example, to see the neighbors for the first polygon in the object:\n\nwm_q[[1]]\n\n[1]  2  3  4 57 85\n\n\nThis indicates that Polygon 1 has five neighbours. The numbers represent the polygon IDs stored in hunan SpatialPolygons Data Frame class.\nThe county name of Polygon ID = 1 can be retrieved as follows:\n\nhunan$County[1]\n\n[1] \"Anxiang\"\n\n\nThe output reveals that Polygon ID = 1 is Anxiang county.\nTo reveal the names of the five neighbouring counties, the code chunk below is used:\n\nhunan$NAME_3[c(2,3,4,57,85)]\n\n[1] \"Hanshou\" \"Jinshi\"  \"Li\"      \"Nan\"     \"Taoyuan\"\n\n\nThe GDPPC of these counties can be obtained via the following code chunk:\n\nnb1 &lt;- wm_q[[1]]\nnb1 &lt;- hunan$GDPPC[nb1]\nnb1\n\n[1] 20981 34592 24473 21311 22879\n\n\nThe output indicates that the GDPPC of the five nearest neighbours of Anxiang county, based on the Queen’s method, are 20981, 34592, 24473, 21311 and 22879.\nThe complete weight matrix can be displayed using str():\n\nstr(wm_q)\n\nList of 88\n $ : int [1:5] 2 3 4 57 85\n $ : int [1:5] 1 57 58 78 85\n $ : int [1:4] 1 4 5 85\n $ : int [1:4] 1 3 5 6\n $ : int [1:4] 3 4 6 85\n $ : int [1:5] 4 5 69 75 85\n $ : int [1:4] 67 71 74 84\n $ : int [1:7] 9 46 47 56 78 80 86\n $ : int [1:6] 8 66 68 78 84 86\n $ : int [1:8] 16 17 19 20 22 70 72 73\n $ : int [1:3] 14 17 72\n $ : int [1:5] 13 60 61 63 83\n $ : int [1:4] 12 15 60 83\n $ : int [1:3] 11 15 17\n $ : int [1:4] 13 14 17 83\n $ : int [1:5] 10 17 22 72 83\n $ : int [1:7] 10 11 14 15 16 72 83\n $ : int [1:5] 20 22 23 77 83\n $ : int [1:6] 10 20 21 73 74 86\n $ : int [1:7] 10 18 19 21 22 23 82\n $ : int [1:5] 19 20 35 82 86\n $ : int [1:5] 10 16 18 20 83\n $ : int [1:7] 18 20 38 41 77 79 82\n $ : int [1:5] 25 28 31 32 54\n $ : int [1:5] 24 28 31 33 81\n $ : int [1:4] 27 33 42 81\n $ : int [1:3] 26 29 42\n $ : int [1:5] 24 25 33 49 54\n $ : int [1:3] 27 37 42\n $ : int 33\n $ : int [1:8] 24 25 32 36 39 40 56 81\n $ : int [1:8] 24 31 50 54 55 56 75 85\n $ : int [1:5] 25 26 28 30 81\n $ : int [1:3] 36 45 80\n $ : int [1:6] 21 41 47 80 82 86\n $ : int [1:6] 31 34 40 45 56 80\n $ : int [1:4] 29 42 43 44\n $ : int [1:4] 23 44 77 79\n $ : int [1:5] 31 40 42 43 81\n $ : int [1:6] 31 36 39 43 45 79\n $ : int [1:6] 23 35 45 79 80 82\n $ : int [1:7] 26 27 29 37 39 43 81\n $ : int [1:6] 37 39 40 42 44 79\n $ : int [1:4] 37 38 43 79\n $ : int [1:6] 34 36 40 41 79 80\n $ : int [1:3] 8 47 86\n $ : int [1:5] 8 35 46 80 86\n $ : int [1:5] 50 51 52 53 55\n $ : int [1:4] 28 51 52 54\n $ : int [1:5] 32 48 52 54 55\n $ : int [1:3] 48 49 52\n $ : int [1:5] 48 49 50 51 54\n $ : int [1:3] 48 55 75\n $ : int [1:6] 24 28 32 49 50 52\n $ : int [1:5] 32 48 50 53 75\n $ : int [1:7] 8 31 32 36 78 80 85\n $ : int [1:6] 1 2 58 64 76 85\n $ : int [1:5] 2 57 68 76 78\n $ : int [1:4] 60 61 87 88\n $ : int [1:4] 12 13 59 61\n $ : int [1:7] 12 59 60 62 63 77 87\n $ : int [1:3] 61 77 87\n $ : int [1:4] 12 61 77 83\n $ : int [1:2] 57 76\n $ : int 76\n $ : int [1:5] 9 67 68 76 84\n $ : int [1:4] 7 66 76 84\n $ : int [1:5] 9 58 66 76 78\n $ : int [1:3] 6 75 85\n $ : int [1:3] 10 72 73\n $ : int [1:3] 7 73 74\n $ : int [1:5] 10 11 16 17 70\n $ : int [1:5] 10 19 70 71 74\n $ : int [1:6] 7 19 71 73 84 86\n $ : int [1:6] 6 32 53 55 69 85\n $ : int [1:7] 57 58 64 65 66 67 68\n $ : int [1:7] 18 23 38 61 62 63 83\n $ : int [1:7] 2 8 9 56 58 68 85\n $ : int [1:7] 23 38 40 41 43 44 45\n $ : int [1:8] 8 34 35 36 41 45 47 56\n $ : int [1:6] 25 26 31 33 39 42\n $ : int [1:5] 20 21 23 35 41\n $ : int [1:9] 12 13 15 16 17 18 22 63 77\n $ : int [1:6] 7 9 66 67 74 86\n $ : int [1:11] 1 2 3 5 6 32 56 57 69 75 ...\n $ : int [1:9] 8 9 19 21 35 46 47 74 84\n $ : int [1:4] 59 61 62 88\n $ : int [1:2] 59 87\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"nb\"\n - attr(*, \"region.id\")= chr [1:88] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n - attr(*, \"call\")= language poly2nb(pl = hunan, queen = TRUE)\n - attr(*, \"type\")= chr \"queen\"\n - attr(*, \"sym\")= logi TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below is used to compute the ROOK contiguity weight matrix:\n\nwm_r &lt;- poly2nb(hunan,queen = FALSE)\nsummary(wm_r)\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 440 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.681818 \nAverage number of links: 5 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 \n 2  2 12 20 21 14 11  3  2  1 \n2 least connected regions:\n30 65 with 1 link\n1 most connected region:\n85 with 10 links\n\n\nThe summary report indicates that there are 88 regions in Hunan.

As we are currently working with polygons, we will need to get points in order to make connectivity graphs. The most typical method for this is polygon centroids, which can be calculated using the sf package before moving onto the graphs.\n\n\nWe will need points to associate with each polygon before making the connectivity graph. It will be a little more complicated than just running st_centroid() on the sf object: us.bound.\nWe need the coordinates in a separate data frame. To do this we will use a mapping function which applies a given function to each element of a vector and returns a vector of the same length. Our input vector will be the geometry column of us.bound. Our function will be st_centroid(). We will use a map_dbl variation of map from the purrr package.\nTo get our longitude values we map the st_centroid() function over the geometry column of us.bound and access the longitude value through double bracket notation [[]] and 1. This allows us to get only the longitude, which is the first value in each centroid.\n\nlongitude &lt;- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])\n\nWe do the same for latitude with one key difference - we access the second value for each centroid with [[2]]:\n\nlatitude &lt;- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])\n\nWith latitude and longitude, we use cbind to put longitude and latitude into the same object:\n\ncoords &lt;- cbind(longitude, latitude)\n\nWe check the first few observations to see if things are formatted correctly:\n\nhead(coords)\n\n     longitude latitude\n[1,]  112.1531 29.44362\n[2,]  112.0372 28.86489\n[3,]  111.8917 29.47107\n[4,]  111.7031 29.74499\n[5,]  111.6138 29.49258\n[6,]  111.0341 29.79863\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\")\nplot(wm_q, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col= \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\")\nplot(wm_r, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\", main=\"Queen Contiguity\")\nplot(wm_q, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col= \"red\")\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\", main=\"ROOK Contiguity\")\nplot(wm_r, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will derive distance-based weight matrices using dnearneigh() of spdep package.\nThe function identifies neighbours of region points by Euclidean distance with a distance band of lower d1= and upper d2= bounds controlled by the bounds= argument. If unprojected coordinates are used and either specified in the coordinates object x or with x as a two column matrix and longlat=TRUE, great circle distances in km will be calculated assuming the WGS84 reference ellipsoid.\n\n\nFirstly, the upper limit for distance band is determined using the steps below:\n\nReturn a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours of each other by using knearneigh() of spdep.\nConvert the knn object returned by knearneigh() to a neighbours list of class nb with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using knn2nb().\nReturn the length of neighbour relationship edges by using nbdists() of spdep. The function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, or otherwise in km.\nRemove the list structure of the returned object by using unlist().\n\n\n#coords &lt;- coordinates(hunan)\nk1 &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))\nk1dists &lt;- unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE))\nsummary(k1dists)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

The output of 1 indicates that the entire spatial network consists of a single connected component i.e. is a path between any two regions in the spatial network, meaning that all regions are interconnected directly or indirectly.\nFurther details below:\n\nIf n_comp$nc returns a value of 1, it means that all regions in wm_d62 form a single connected component—i.e., every region is reachable from every other region through neighboring connections.\nIf n_comp$nc returns a value greater than 1, it means there are multiple disconnected groups of regions, where regions in one group cannot be reached from regions in another group through the neighbor links.\n\n\ntable(n_comp$comp.id)\n\n\n 1 \n88 \n\n\nThe code above then generates a frequency table of the connected components and the output indicates that all 88 regions in Hunan are part of a unique connected component (ID = 1).\n\n\nThe distance weight matrix is plotted using the following code chunk:\n\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\")\nplot(wm_d62, coords, add=TRUE)\nplot(k1, coords, add=TRUE, col=\"red\", length=0.08)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe red lines show the links of 1st nearest neighbours and the black lines show the links of neighbours within the cut-off distance of 62km.\nAlternatively, both lines can be plotted in adjacent charts uing the code chunk below:\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\", main=\"1st nearest neighbours\")\nplot(k1, coords, add=TRUE, col=\"red\", length=0.08)\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\", main=\"Distance link\")\nplot(wm_d62, coords, add=TRUE, pch = 19, cex = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the characteristics of fixed distance weight matrix is that more densely settled areas (usually the urban areas) tend to have more neighbours and the less densely settled areas (usually the rural counties) tend to have lesser neighbours. Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.\nIt is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using k-nearest neighbours, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown in the code chunk below:\n\nknn6 &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=6))\nknn6\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 528

In our case, each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style=“W”). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values.\nWhile this is the most intuitive way to summarise the neighbors’ values, it has one drawback in that the polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data. For this example, we’ll stick with the style=“W” option for simplicity’s sake but there are other more robust options are available, notably style=“B”.\n\nrswm_q &lt;- nb2listw(wm_q, style=\"W\", zero.policy = TRUE)\nrswm_q\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn S0       S1       S2\nW 88 7744 88 37.86334 365.9147\n\n\nThe zero.policy=TRUE option allows for lists of non-neighbors. Note that this should be used with caution as the user may not be aware of missing neighbors in their dataset however, a zero.policy=FALSE would return an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS0, S1 and S2 are used to compute measures of spatial autocorrelation like Moran’s I.\n\n\n\n\nS0 = 88\n\nS0 is the sum of the weights. In the case of row-standardized weights, this equals the number of regions (88), because the sum of the weights for each region is 1.\n\nS1 = 37.86334\n\nS1 is a measure of the sum of the squared weights. It is used in the calculation of spatial autocorrelation statistics like Moran’s I to adjust for differences in the number of neighbors each region has.\n\nS2 = 365.9147\n\nS2 is another constant used in spatial autocorrelation calculations. It involves the sum of squared differences in the weights between regions and their neighbors, giving insight into the variation of the weighting structure across the spatial units.\n\n\n\n\nTo see the weight of the first polygon’s eight neighbors type:\n\nrswm_q$weights[1]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2\n\n\nEach neighbor is assigned a 0.2 of the total weight. This means that when R computes the average neighboring income values, each neighbor’s income will be multiplied by 0.2 before being tallied.\nUsing the same method, we can also derive a row standardised distance weight matrix by using the code chunk below:\n\nrswm_ids &lt;- nb2listw(wm_q, glist=ids, style=\"B\", zero.policy=TRUE)\nrswm_ids\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn       S0        S1     S2\nB 88 7744 8.786867 0.3776535 3.8137\n\n\n\nrswm_ids$weights[1]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 0.01535405 0.03916350 0.01820896 0.02807922 0.01145113\n\n\n\nsummary(unlist(rswm_ids$weights))\n\n    Min.  1st Qu.

The weights describe the spatial relationships between regions, where each region is assigned weights corresponding to its neighbors.\nwm_q: This is the neighbor list object, which defines the spatial neighbors for each region. It specifies which regions are neighbors to each other (e.g., through contiguity, distance, or k-nearest neighbors).\nglist=ids: This specifies the weights to be applied to the neighbors in wm_q. The ids list contains inverse distance weights for each region’s neighbors. Inverse distance weights mean that the strength of the spatial relationship between two regions is inversely proportional to the distance between them (i.e., closer regions have higher weights, and farther regions have lower weights).\nstyle=\"B\": The \"B\" style stands for binary weights. However, in this case, it means that the weights will not be normalized or row-standardized. Each weight will be based on the raw values provided in the glist (inverse distance values).

As we are currently working with polygons, we will need to get points in order to make connectivity graphs. The most typical method for this is polygon centroids, which can be calculated using the sf package before moving onto the graphs.\n\n\nWe will need points to associate with each polygon before making the connectivity graph. It will be a little more complicated than just running st_centroid() on the sf object: us.bound.\nWe need the coordinates in a separate data frame. To do this we will use a mapping function which applies a given function to each element of a vector and returns a vector of the same length. Our input vector will be the geometry column of us.bound. Our function will be st_centroid(). We will use a map_dbl variation of map from the purrr package.\nTo get our longitude values we map the st_centroid() function over the geometry column of us.bound and access the longitude value through double bracket notation [[]] and 1. This allows us to get only the longitude, which is the first value in each centroid.\n\nlongitude &lt;- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])\n\nWe do the same for latitude with one key difference - we access the second value for each centroid with [[2]]:\n\nlatitude &lt;- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])\n\nWith latitude and longitude, we use cbind to put longitude and latitude into the same object:\n\ncoords &lt;- cbind(longitude, latitude)\n\nWe check the first few observations to see if things are formatted correctly:\n\nhead(coords)\n\n     longitude latitude\n[1,]  112.1531 29.44362\n[2,]  112.0372 28.86489\n[3,]  111.8917 29.47107\n[4,]  111.7031 29.74499\n[5,]  111.6138 29.49258\n[6,]  111.0341 29.79863\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\")\nplot(wm_q, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col= \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\")\nplot(wm_r, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\", main=\"Queen Contiguity\")\nplot(wm_q, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col= \"red\")\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\", main=\"ROOK Contiguity\")\nplot(wm_r, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col = \"red\")"

The output of 1 indicates that the entire spatial network consists of a single connected component i.e. is a path between any two regions in the spatial network, meaning that all regions are interconnected directly or indirectly.\nFurther details below:\n\nIf n_comp$nc returns a value of 1, it means that all regions in wm_d62 form a single connected component—i.e., every region is reachable from every other region through neighboring connections.\nIf n_comp$nc returns a value greater than 1, it means there are multiple disconnected groups of regions, where regions in one group cannot be reached from regions in another group through the neighbor links.\n\n\ntable(n_comp$comp.id)\n\n\n 1 \n88 \n\n\nThe code above then generates a frequency table of the connected components and the output indicates that all 88 regions in Hunan are part of a unique connected component (ID = 1).\n\n\nThe distance weight matrix is plotted using the following code chunk:\n\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\")\nplot(wm_d62, coords, add=TRUE)\nplot(k1, coords, add=TRUE, col=\"red\", length=0.08)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe red lines show the links of 1st nearest neighbours and the black lines show the links of neighbours within the cut-off distance of 62km.\nAlternatively, both lines can be plotted in adjacent charts uing the code chunk below:\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\", main=\"1st nearest neighbours\")\nplot(k1, coords, add=TRUE, col=\"red\", length=0.08)\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\", main=\"Distance link\")\nplot(wm_d62, coords, add=TRUE, pch = 19, cex = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the characteristics of fixed distance weight matrix is that more densely settled areas (usually the urban areas) tend to have more neighbours and the less densely settled areas (usually the rural counties) tend to have lesser neighbours. Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.\nIt is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using k-nearest neighbours, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown in the code chunk below:\n\nknn6 &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=6))\nknn6\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 528 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 6.818182 \nAverage number of links: 6 \nNon-symmetric neighbours list\n\n\nThe content of the matrix can be displayed by using str():\n\nstr(knn6)\n\nList of 88\n $ : int [1:6] 2 3 4 5 57 64\n $ : int [1:6] 1 3 57 58 78 85\n $ : int [1:6] 1 2 4 5 57 85\n $ : int [1:6] 1 3 5 6 69 85\n $ : int [1:6] 1 3 4 6 69 85\n $ : int [1:6] 3 4 5 69 75 85\n $ : int [1:6] 9 66 67 71 74 84\n $ : int [1:6] 9 46 47 78 80 86\n $ : int [1:6] 8 46 66 68 84 86\n $ : int [1:6] 16 19 22 70 72 73\n $ : int [1:6] 10 14 16 17 70 72\n $ : int [1:6] 13 15 60 61 63 83\n $ : int [1:6] 12 15 60 61 63 83\n $ : int [1:6] 11 15 16 17 72 83\n $ : int [1:6] 12 13 14 17 60 83\n $ : int [1:6] 10 11 17 22 72 83\n $ : int [1:6] 10 11 14 16 72 83\n $ : int [1:6] 20 22 23 63 77 83\n $ : int [1:6] 10 20 21 73 74 82\n $ : int [1:6] 18 19 21 22 23 82\n $ : int [1:6] 19 20 35 74 82 86\n $ : int [1:6] 10 16 18 19 20 83\n $ : int [1:6] 18 20 41 77 79 82\n $ : int [1:6] 25 28 31 52 54 81\n $ : int [1:6] 24 28 31 33 54 81\n $ : int [1:6] 25 27 29 33 42 81\n $ : int [1:6] 26 29 30 37 42 81\n $ : int [1:6] 24 25 33 49 52 54\n $ : int [1:6] 26 27 37 42 43 81\n $ : int [1:6] 26 27 28 33 49 81\n $ : int [1:6] 24 25 36 39 40 54\n $ : int [1:6] 24 31 50 54 55 56\n $ : int [1:6] 25 26 28 30 49 81\n $ : int [1:6] 36 40 41 45 56 80\n $ : int [1:6] 21 41 46 47 80 82\n $ : int [1:6] 31 34 40 45 56 80\n $ : int [1:6] 26 27 29 42 43 44\n $ : int [1:6] 23 43 44 62 77 79\n $ : int [1:6] 25 40 42 43 44 81\n $ : int [1:6] 31 36 39 43 45 79\n $ : int [1:6] 23 35 45 79 80 82\n $ : int [1:6] 26 27 37 39 43 81\n $ : int [1:6] 37 39 40 42 44 79\n $ : int [1:6] 37 38 39 42 43 79\n $ : int [1:6] 34 36 40 41 79 80\n $ : int [1:6] 8 9 35 47 78 86\n $ : int [1:6] 8 21 35 46 80 86\n $ : int [1:6] 49 50 51 52 53 55\n $ : int [1:6] 28 33 48 51 52 54\n $ : int [1:6] 32 48 51 52 54 55\n $ : int [1:6] 28 48 49 50 52 54\n $ : int [1:6] 28 48 49 50 51 54\n $ : int [1:6] 48 50 51 52 55 75\n $ : int [1:6] 24 28 49 50 51 52\n $ : int [1:6] 32 48 50 52 53 75\n $ : int [1:6] 32 34 36 78 80 85\n $ : int [1:6] 1 2 3 58 64 68\n $ : int [1:6] 2 57 64 66 68 78\n $ : int [1:6] 12 13 60 61 87 88\n $ : int [1:6] 12 13 59 61 63 87\n $ : int [1:6] 12 13 60 62 63 87\n $ : int [1:6] 12 38 61 63 77 87\n $ : int [1:6] 12 18 60 61 62 83\n $ : int [1:6] 1 3 57 58 68 76\n $ : int [1:6] 58 64 66 67 68 76\n $ : int [1:6] 9 58 67 68 76 84\n $ : int [1:6] 7 65 66 68 76 84\n $ : int [1:6] 9 57 58 66 78 84\n $ : int [1:6] 4 5 6 32 75 85\n $ : int [1:6] 10 16 19 22 72 73\n $ : int [1:6] 7 19 73 74 84 86\n $ : int [1:6] 10 11 14 16 17 70\n $ : int [1:6] 10 19 21 70 71 74\n $ : int [1:6] 19 21 71 73 84 86\n $ : int [1:6] 6 32 50 53 55 69\n $ : int [1:6] 58 64 65 66 67 68\n $ : int [1:6] 18 23 38 61 62 63\n $ : int [1:6] 2 8 9 46 58 68\n $ : int [1:6] 38 40 41 43 44 45\n $ : int [1:6] 34 35 36 41 45 47\n $ : int [1:6] 25 26 28 33 39 42\n $ : int [1:6] 19 20 21 23 35 41\n $ : int [1:6] 12 13 15 16 22 63\n $ : int [1:6] 7 9 66 68 71 74\n $ : int [1:6] 2 3 4 5 56 69\n $ : int [1:6] 8 9 21 46 47 74\n $ : int [1:6] 59 60 61 62 63 88\n $ : int [1:6] 59 60 61 62 63 87\n - attr(*, \"region.id\")= chr [1:88] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n - attr(*, \"call\")= language knearneigh(x = coords, k = 6)\n - attr(*, \"sym\")= logi FALSE\n - attr(*, \"type\")= chr \"knn\"\n - attr(*, \"knn-k\")= num 6\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"nb\"\n\n\nNote that each county has six neighbours.\n\n\nThe weight matrix can be plotted using the code chunk below:\n\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\")\nplot(knn6, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col = \"red\")"

    "text": "Next, we need to assign weights to each neighboring polygon. In our case, each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style=“W”). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values.\nWhile this is the most intuitive way to summarise the neighbors’ values, it has one drawback in that the polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data. For this example, we’ll stick with the style=“W” option for simplicity’s sake but there are other more robust options are available, notably style=“B”.\n\nrswm_q &lt;- nb2listw(wm_q, style=\"W\", zero.policy = TRUE)\nrswm_q\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn S0       S1       S2\nW 88 7744 88 37.86334 365.9147\n\n\nThe zero.policy=TRUE option allows for lists of non-neighbors. Note that this should be used with caution as the user may not be aware of missing neighbors in their dataset however, a zero.policy=FALSE would return an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS0, S1 and S2 are used to compute measures of spatial autocorrelation like Moran’s I.\n\n\n\n\nS0 = 88\n\nS0 is the sum of the weights. In the case of row-standardized weights, this equals the number of regions (88), because the sum of the weights for each region is 1.\n\nS1 = 37.86334\n\nS1 is a measure of the sum of the squared weights. It is used in the calculation of spatial autocorrelation statistics like Moran’s I to adjust for differences in the number of neighbors each region has.\n\nS2 = 365.9147\n\nS2 is another constant used in spatial autocorrelation calculations. It involves the sum of squared differences in the weights between regions and their neighbors, giving insight into the variation of the weighting structure across the spatial units.\n\n\n\n\nTo see the weight of the first polygon’s eight neighbors type:\n\nrswm_q$weights[1]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2\n\n\nEach neighbor is assigned a 0.2 of the total weight. This means that when R computes the average neighboring income values, each neighbor’s income will be multiplied by 0.2 before being tallied.\nUsing the same method, we can also derive a row standardised distance weight matrix by using the code chunk below:\n\nrswm_ids &lt;- nb2listw(wm_q, glist=ids, style=\"B\", zero.policy=TRUE)\nrswm_ids\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn       S0        S1     S2\nB 88 7744 8.786867 0.3776535 3.8137\n\n\n\nrswm_ids$weights[1]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 0.01535405 0.03916350 0.01820896 0.02807922 0.01145113\n\n\n\nsummary(unlist(rswm_ids$weights))\n\n    Min.  1st Qu.

The weights describe the spatial relationships between regions, where each region is assigned weights corresponding to its neighbors.\nwm_q: This is the neighbor list object, which defines the spatial neighbors for each region. It specifies which regions are neighbors to each other (e.g., through contiguity, distance, or k-nearest neighbors).\nglist=ids: This specifies the weights to be applied to the neighbors in wm_q. The ids list contains inverse distance weights for each region’s neighbors. Inverse distance weights mean that the strength of the spatial relationship between two regions is inversely proportional to the distance between them (i.e., closer regions have higher weights, and farther regions have lower weights).\nstyle=\"B\": The \"B\" style stands for binary weights. However, in this case, it means that the weights will not be normalized or row-standardized. Each weight will be based on the raw values provided in the glist (inverse distance values). The weight matrix will reflect the exact values in glist=ids.\nzero.policy=TRUE: This option ensures that regions with no neighbors (isolated regions) are handled properly. If zero.policy=TRUE, isolated regions will be assigned a weight of 0 instead of causing an error.\n\nrswm_ids: This stores the resulting spatial weights matrix (weights list object) created by nb2listw()."

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, we will compute Global Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation (GMSA) using spdep package. The learning points of this hands-on exercise are to:\n\nimport geospatial data using appropriate function(s) of sf package,\nimport csv file using appropriate function of readr package,\nperform relational join using appropriate join function of dplyr package,\ncompute Global Spatial Autocorrelation (GSA) statistics by using appropriate functions of spdep package,\n\nplot Moran scatterplot,\ncompute and plot spatial correlogram using appropriate function of spdep package.\n\nprovide statistically correct interpretation of GSA statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn spatial policy, one of the main development objective of the local government and planners is to ensure equal distribution of development in the province. Our task in this study, hence, is to apply appropriate spatial statistical methods to discover if development are even distributed geographically. If the answer is No. Then, our next question will be “is there sign of spatial clustering?”. And, if the answer for this question is yes, then our next question will be “where are these clusters?”\nIn this case study, we are interested to examine the spatial pattern of a selected development indicator (i.e. GDP per capita) of Hunan Provice, People Republic of China.\n\n\n\nTwo data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise, they are:\n\nHunan province administrative boundary layer at county level. This is a geospatial data set in ESRI shapefile format.\nHunan_2012.csv: This csv file contains selected Hunan’s local development indicators in 2012.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we get started, we need to ensure that spdep, sf, tmap and tidyverse packages of R are installed in R.\n\nsf is use for importing and handling geospatial data in R,\ntidyverse is mainly use for wrangling attribute data in R,\nspdep will be used to compute spatial weights, global and local spatial autocorrelation statistics, and\ntmap will be used to prepare cartographic quality chropleth map.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to perform the following tasks:\n\ncreating a package list containing the necessary R packages,\nchecking if the R packages in the package list have been installed in R,\n\nif they have yet to be installed, RStudio will installed the missing packages,\n\nlaunching the packages into R environment.\n\n\npacman::p_load(sf,tidyverse,spdep,tmap)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will bring a geospatial data and its associated attribute table into R environment. The geospatial data is in ESRI shapefile format and the attribute table is in csv fomat.\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses st_read() of sf package to import Hunan shapefile into R. The imported shapefile will be a simple features object of sf.\n\nhunan &lt;- st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\",\n                 layer = \"Hunan\")\n\nReading layer `Hunan' from data source \n  `C:\\mooseksm\\ISSS626-GAA\\Hands-on_Ex\\Hands-on_Ex05\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 88 features and 7 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 108.7831 ymin: 24.6342 xmax: 114.2544 ymax: 30.12812\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\nWe note that the simple features data has a polygon geometry and has 88 features and 7 fields. It is in WGS84 geographic coordinate system.\n\n\n\nNext, we will import Hunan_2012.csv into R using read_csv() of readr package. The output is in R data frame class.\n\nhunan2012 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to update the attribute table of hunan’s SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with the attribute fields of hunan2012 dataframe. This is performed by using left_join() of dplyr package:\n\nhunan &lt;- left_join(hunan,hunan2012)%&gt;%\n  select(1:4,7,15)\n\n\n\n\nNow, we are going to prepare a basemap and a choropleth map showing the distribution of GDPPC 2012 by using qtm() of tmap package.\n\nequal &lt;- tm_shape(hunan) +\n  tm_fill(\"GDPPC\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Equal interval classification\",\n            main.title.size = 1,\n            legend.text.size = 0.6,\n            legend.height = 1.20,\n            legend.width = 1.20,\n            frame = TRUE)\n\nquantile &lt;- tm_shape(hunan) +\n  tm_fill(\"GDPPC\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Equal quantile classification\",\n            main.title.size = 1,\n            legend.text.size = 0.6,\n            legend.height = 1.20,\n            legend.width = 1.20,\n            frame = TRUE)\n\ntmap_arrange(equal,\n             quantile,\n             asp = 1,\n             ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will compute global spatial autocorrelation statistics and perform spatial complete randomness test for global spatial autocorrelation.\n\n\nBefore we can compute the global spatial autocorrelation statistics, we need to construct spatial weights of the study area. The spatial weights is used to define the neighbourhood relationships between the geographical units (i.e. county) in the study area.\nIn the code chunk below, poly2nb() of spdep package is used to compute contiguity weight matrices for the study area. This function builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries. Based on the documentation, note that the “queen” argument can take TRUE or FALSE as options. If not specified, the default is set to TRUE and the function will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen criteria (which is on the basis of shared boundaries):\nThe code chunk below is used to compute Queen contiguity weight matrix:\n\nwm_q &lt;- poly2nb(hunan,\n                queen = TRUE)\n\nsummary(wm_q)\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 11 \n 2  2 12 16 24 14 11  4  2  1 \n2 least connected regions:\n30 65 with 1 link\n1 most connected region:\n85 with 11 links\n\n\nThe summary report shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connected area unit has 11 neighbours and there are two ara units with only one neighbour.\n\n\n\nNext, we need to assign weights to each neighboring polygon. In our case, each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style=“W”). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summarise the neighbors’ values, it has one drawback in that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data. For this example, we’ll stick with the style=“W” option for simplicity’s sake but note that other more robust options are available, notably style=“B”.\n\nrswm_q &lt;- nb2listw(wm_q,\n                   style = \"W\",\n                   zero.policy = TRUE)\nrswm_q\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn S0       S1       S2\nW 88 7744 88 37.86334 365.9147\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we learn from the code chunk above?\n\n\n\n\nThe input of nb2listw() must be an object of class nb. The syntax of the function has two major arguments, namely style and zero.policy.\nstyle can take values “W”, “B”, “C”, “U”, “minmax” and “S”.\n\nB is the basic binary coding\nW is row standardised (sums over all links to n)\nC is globally standardised (sums over all links to n)\nU is equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity)\nS is the variance-stabilizing coding scheme proposed by Tiefelsdorf et al. 1999, p. 167-168 (sums over all links to n).\n\nIf zero policy is set to TRUE, weights vectors of zero length are inserted for regions without neighbour in the neighbours list. These will in turn generate lag values of zero, equivalent to the sum of products of the zero row t(rep(0, length=length(neighbours))) %*% x, for arbitrary numerical vector x of length length(neighbours). The spatially lagged value of x for the zero-neighbour region will then be zero, which may (or may not) be a sensible choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMoran’s I and Geary’s C are two common measures used in spatial statistics to assess the degree of spatial autocorrelation—that is, how spatially similar or dissimilar neighboring regions are to one another based on a given variable. Both are used to analyze whether similar values cluster together in space or if there is a random or dispersed pattern.\n\nMoran’s I is a global measure of spatial autocorrelation. It compares the similarity of values across neighboring regions and indicates whether similar or dissimilar values are spatially clustered.\nGeary’s C focuses more on local differences between pairs of neighboring regions. It tends to be more sensitive to local variations than Moran’s I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will perform Moran’s I statistics testing using moran.test() of spdep.\n\n\nThe code chunk below performs Moran’s I statistical testing using moran.test() of spdep.\n\nmoran.test(hunan$GDPPC,\n           listw = rswm_q,\n           zero.policy = TRUE,\n           na.action = na.omit)\n\n\n    Moran I test under randomisation\n\ndata:  hunan$GDPPC  \nweights: rswm_q    \n\nMoran I statistic standard deviate = 4.7351, p-value = 1.095e-06\nalternative hypothesis: greater\nsample estimates:\nMoran I statistic       Expectation          Variance \n      0.300749970      -0.011494253       0.004348351 \n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below performs the permutation test for Moran’s I statistic using moran.mc() of spdep. A total of 1000 simulations will be performed.\n\nset.seed(1234)\nbperm = moran.mc(hunan$GDPPC,\n                 listw = rswm_q,\n                 nsim = 999,\n                 zero.policy = TRUE,\n                 na.action = na.omit)\nbperm\n\n\n    Monte-Carlo simulation of Moran I\n\ndata:  hunan$GDPPC \nweights: rswm_q  \nnumber of simulations + 1: 1000 \n\nstatistic = 0.30075, observed rank = 1000, p-value = 0.001\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is always a good practice to examine the simulated Moran’s I test statistics in greater detail.

They show how correlated pairs of spatial observations are when you increase the distance (lag) between them - they are plots of some index of autocorrelation (Moran’s I or Geary’s c) against distance. Although correlograms are not as fundamental as variograms (a keystone concept of geostatistics), they are very useful as an exploratory and descriptive tool. For this purpose they actually provide richer information than variograms.\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, sp.correlogram() of spdep package is used to compute a 6-lag spatial correlogram of GDPPC. The global spatial autocorrelation used is Moran’s I (note method = “I” in code below). The plot() of base Graph is then used to plot the output.\n\nMI_corr &lt;- sp.correlogram(wm_q,\n                          hunan$GDPPC,\n                          order = 6,\n                          method = \"I\",\n                          style = \"W\")\nplot(MI_corr)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the output might not allow us to provide complete interpretation. This is because not all autocorrelation values are statistically significant. Hence, it is important for us to examine the full analysis report by printing out the analysis results as in the code chunk below.\n\nprint(MI_corr)\n\nSpatial correlogram for hunan$GDPPC \nmethod: Moran's I\n         estimate expectation   variance standard deviate Pr(I) two sided    \n1 (88)  0.3007500  -0.0114943  0.0043484           4.7351       2.189e-06 ***\n2 (88)  0.2060084  -0.0114943  0.0020962           4.7505       2.029e-06 ***\n3 (88)  0.0668273  -0.0114943  0.0014602           2.0496        0.040400 *  \n4 (88)  0.0299470  -0.0114943  0.0011717           1.2107        0.226015    \n5 (88) -0.1530471  -0.0114943  0.0012440          -4.0134       5.984e-05 ***\n6 (88) -0.1187070  -0.0114943  0.0016791          -2.6164        0.008886 ** \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInterpretation:\n\nLag 1 shows significant positive spatial autocorrelation, meaning nearby regions tend to have similar GDPPC values.\nAs the lags increase, spatial autocorrelation diminishes and eventually becomes slightly negative (indicating dissimilarity between regions further apart), but with wider error bars indicating less significance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, sp.correlogram() of spdep package is used to compute a 6-lag spatial correlogram of GDPPC.

Using the original spatial weights matrix allows the correlogram to reflect the true intensity of spatial autocorrelation at various distances.\nRow-standardizing weights can distort the actual spatial influence by giving an equal contribution to all neighboring observations, regardless of their spatial closeness or the intensity of their spatial relationship. This could obscure patterns of spatial autocorrelation that are distance-dependent."

    "text": "In this section, we will compute global spatial autocorrelation statistics and perform spatial complete randomness test for global spatial autocorrelation.\n\n\nBefore we can compute the global spatial autocorrelation statistics, we need to construct spatial weights of the study area. The spatial weights is used to define the neighbourhood relationships between the geographical units (i.e. county) in the study area.\nIn the code chunk below, poly2nb() of spdep package is used to compute contiguity weight matrices for the study area. This function builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries. Based on the documentation, note that the “queen” argument can take TRUE or FALSE as options. If not specified, the default is set to TRUE and the function will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen criteria (which is on the basis of shared boundaries):\nThe code chunk below is used to compute Queen contiguity weight matrix:\n\nwm_q &lt;- poly2nb(hunan,\n                queen = TRUE)\n\nsummary(wm_q)\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 11 \n 2  2 12 16 24 14 11  4  2  1 \n2 least connected regions:\n30 65 with 1 link\n1 most connected region:\n85 with 11 links\n\n\nThe summary report shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connected area unit has 11 neighbours and there are two ara units with only one neighbour.\n\n\n\nNext, we need to assign weights to each neighboring polygon. In our case, each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style=“W”). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summarise the neighbors’ values, it has one drawback in that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data. For this example, we’ll stick with the style=“W” option for simplicity’s sake but note that other more robust options are available, notably style=“B”.\n\nrswm_q &lt;- nb2listw(wm_q,\n                   style = \"W\",\n                   zero.policy = TRUE)\nrswm_q\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn S0       S1       S2\nW 88 7744 88 37.86334 365.9147\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we learn from the code chunk above?\n\n\n\n\nThe input of nb2listw() must be an object of class nb. The syntax of the function has two major arguments, namely style and zero.policy.\nstyle can take values “W”, “B”, “C”, “U”, “minmax” and “S”.\n\nB is the basic binary coding\nW is row standardised (sums over all links to n)\nC is globally standardised (sums over all links to n)\nU is equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity)\nS is the variance-stabilizing coding scheme proposed by Tiefelsdorf et al. 1999, p. 167-168 (sums over all links to n).\n\nIf zero policy is set to TRUE, weights vectors of zero length are inserted for regions without neighbour in the neighbours list. These will in turn generate lag values of zero, equivalent to the sum of products of the zero row t(rep(0, length=length(neighbours))) %*% x, for arbitrary numerical vector x of length length(neighbours). The spatially lagged value of x for the zero-neighbour region will then be zero, which may (or may not) be a sensible choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMoran’s I and Geary’s C are two common measures used in spatial statistics to assess the degree of spatial autocorrelation—that is, how spatially similar or dissimilar neighboring regions are to one another based on a given variable. Both are used to analyze whether similar values cluster together in space or if there is a random or dispersed pattern.\n\nMoran’s I is a global measure of spatial autocorrelation. It compares the similarity of values across neighboring regions and indicates whether similar or dissimilar values are spatially clustered.\nGeary’s C focuses more on local differences between pairs of neighboring regions. It tends to be more sensitive to local variations than Moran’s I."

    "text": "Spatial correlograms are great for examining patterns of spatial autocorrelation in your data or model residuals. They show how correlated pairs of spatial observations are when you increase the distance (lag) between them - they are plots of some index of autocorrelation (Moran’s I or Geary’s c) against distance. Although correlograms are not as fundamental as variograms (a keystone concept of geostatistics), they are very useful as an exploratory and descriptive tool. For this purpose they actually provide richer information than variograms.\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, sp.correlogram() of spdep package is used to compute a 6-lag spatial correlogram of GDPPC. The global spatial autocorrelation used is Moran’s I (note method = “I” in code below). The plot() of base Graph is then used to plot the output.\n\nMI_corr &lt;- sp.correlogram(wm_q,\n                          hunan$GDPPC,\n                          order = 6,\n                          method = \"I\",\n                          style = \"W\")\nplot(MI_corr)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the output might not allow us to provide complete interpretation.

Using the original spatial weights matrix allows the correlogram to reflect the true intensity of spatial autocorrelation at various distances.\nRow-standardizing weights can distort the actual spatial influence by giving an equal contribution to all neighboring observations, regardless of their spatial closeness or the intensity of their spatial relationship. This could obscure patterns of spatial autocorrelation that are distance-dependent."

    "text": "Local Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation (LMSA) focus on the relationships between each observation and its surroundings, rather than providing a single summary of these relationships across the map. In this sense, they are not summary statistics but scores that allow us to learn more about the spatial structure in our data. The general intuition behind the metrics however is similar to that of global ones. Some of them are even mathematically connected, where the global version can be decomposed into a collection of local ones. One such example is Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA). Beside LISA, Getis-Ord’s Gi-statistics will be introduce as an alternative LMSA statistics that present complementary information or allow us to obtain similar insights for geographically referenced data.\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will compute Local Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation (LMSA) using spdep package. By the end to this hands-on exercise, we will be able to:\n\nimport geospatial data using appropriate function(s) of sf package,\nimport csv file using appropriate function of readr package,\nperform relational join using appropriate join function of dplyr package,\ncompute Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) statistics for detecting clusters and outliers by using appropriate functions spdep package;\ncompute Getis-Ord’s Gi-statistics for detecting hot spot or/and cold spot area by using appropriate functions of spdep package; and\nto visualise the analysis output by using tmap package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn spatial policy, one of the main development objective of the local govenment and planners is to ensure equal distribution of development in the province. Our task in this study, hence, is to apply appropriate spatial statistical methods to discover if development are even distributed geographically. If the answer is No. Then, our next question will be “is there sign of spatial clustering?”. And, if the answer for this question is yes, then our next question will be “where are these clusters?”\nIn this case study, we are interested to examine the spatial pattern of a selected development indicator (i.e. GDP per capita) of Hunan Province, People Republic of China.\n\n\n\nTwo data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise, they are:\n\nHunan province administrative boundary layer at county level. This is a geospatial data set in ESRI shapefile format.\nHunan_2012.csv: This csv file contains selected Hunan’s local development indicators in 2012.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we get started, we need to ensure that spdep, sf, tmap and tidyverse packages of R are currently installed in R.\n\nsf is use for importing and handling geospatial data in R,\ntidyverse is mainly use for wrangling attribute data in R,\nspdep will be used to compute spatial weights, global and local spatial autocorrelation statistics, and\ntmap will be used to prepare cartographic quality chropleth map.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to perform the following tasks:\n\ncreating a package list containing the necessary R packages,\nchecking if the R packages in the package list have been installed in R,\n\nif they have yet to be installed, RStudio will installed the missing packages,\n\nlaunching the packages into R environment.\n\n\npacman::p_load(sf,spdep,tmap,tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to bring a geospatial data and its associated attribute table into R environment. The geospatial data is in ESRI shapefile format and the attribute table is in csv fomat.\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses st_read() of sf package to import Hunan shapefile into R. The imported shapefile will be a simple features object of sf.\n\nhunan &lt;- st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\",\n                 layer = \"Hunan\")\n\nReading layer `Hunan' from data source \n  `C:\\mooseksm\\ISSS626-GAA\\Hands-on_Ex\\Hands-on_Ex05\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 88 features and 7 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 108.7831 ymin: 24.6342 xmax: 114.2544 ymax: 30.12812\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\nWe note that the simple features data has a polygon geometry and has 88 features and 7 fields. It is in WGS84 geographic coordinate system.\n\n\n\nNext, we will import Hunan_2012.csv into R using read_csv() of readr package. The output is in R data frame class.\n\nhunan2012 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to update the attribute table of hunan’s SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with the attribute fields of hunan2012 dataframe. This is performed by using left_join() of dplyr package:\n\nhunan &lt;- left_join(hunan,hunan2012)%&gt;%\n  select(1:4,7,15)\n\n\n\n\nNow, we are going to prepare a basemap and a choropleth map showing the distribution of GDPPC 2012 by using qtm() of tmap package.\n\nequal &lt;- tm_shape(hunan) +\n  tm_fill(\"GDPPC\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Equal interval classification\",\n            main.title.size = 1,\n            legend.text.size = 0.6,\n            legend.height = 1.20,\n            legend.width = 1.20,\n            frame = TRUE)\n\nquantile &lt;- tm_shape(hunan) +\n  tm_fill(\"GDPPC\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Equal quantile classification\",\n            main.title.size = 1,\n            legend.text.size = 0.6,\n            legend.height = 1.20,\n            legend.width = 1.20,\n            frame = TRUE)\n\ntmap_arrange(equal,\n             quantile,\n             asp = 1,\n             ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Indicators of Spatial Association or LISA are statistics that evaluate the existence of clusters and/or outliers in the spatial arrangement of a given variable. For instance if we are studying distribution of GDP per capita of Hunan Provice, People Republic of China, local clusters in GDP per capita mean that there are counties that have higher or lower rates than is to be expected by chance alone; that is, the values occurring are above or below those of a random distribution in space.\nIn this section, we will apply appropriate Local Indicators for Spatial Association (LISA), especially local Moran’s I to detect cluster and/or outlier from GDP per capita 2012 of Hunan Province, PRC.\n\n\nBefore we can compute the global spatial autocorrelation statistics, we need to construct spatial weights of the study area. The spatial weights is used to define the neighbourhood relationships between the geographical units (i.e. county) in the study area.\nIn the code chunk below, poly2nb() of spdep package is used to compute contiguity weight matrices for the study area. This function builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries. Based on the documentation, note that the “queen” argument can take TRUE or FALSE as options. If not specified, the default is set to TRUE and the function will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen criteria (which is on the basis of shared boundaries):\nThe code chunk below is used to compute Queen contiguity weight matrix:\n\nwm_q &lt;- poly2nb(hunan,\n                queen = TRUE)\n\nsummary(wm_q)\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 11 \n 2  2 12 16 24 14 11  4  2  1 \n2 least connected regions:\n30 65 with 1 link\n1 most connected region:\n85 with 11 links\n\n\nThe summary report shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connected area unit has 11 neighbours and there are two ara units with only one neighbour.\n\n\n\nNext, we need to assign weights to each neighboring polygon. In our case, each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style=“W”). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summarise the neighbors’ values, it has one drawback in that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data. For this example, we’ll stick with the style=“W” option for simplicity’s sake but note that other more robust options are available, notably style=“B”.\n\nrswm_q &lt;- nb2listw(wm_q,\n                   style = \"W\",\n                   zero.policy = TRUE)\nrswm_q\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn S0       S1       S2\nW 88 7744 88 37.86334 365.9147\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we learn from the code chunk above?\n\n\n\n\nThe input of nb2listw() must be an object of class nb. The syntax of the function has two major arguments, namely style and zero.policy.\nstyle can take values “W”, “B”, “C”, “U”, “minmax” and “S”.\n\nB is the basic binary coding\nW is row standardised (sums over all links to n)\nC is globally standardised (sums over all links to n)\nU is equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity)\nS is the variance-stabilizing coding scheme proposed by Tiefelsdorf et al. 1999, p. 167-168 (sums over all links to n).\n\nIf zero policy is set to TRUE, weights vectors of zero length are inserted for regions without neighbour in the neighbours list. These will in turn generate lag values of zero, equivalent to the sum of products of the zero row t(rep(0, length=length(neighbours))) %*% x, for arbitrary numerical vector x of length length(neighbours). The spatially lagged value of x for the zero-neighbour region will then be zero, which may (or may not) be a sensible choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo compute local Moran’s I, the localmoran() function of spdep will be used. It computes Ii values, given a set of zi values and a listw object providing neighbour weighting information for the polygon associated with the zi values.\nThe code chunks below are used to compute local Moran’s I of GDPPC2012 at the county level.\n\nfips &lt;- order(hunan$County)\nlocalMI &lt;- localmoran(hunan$GDPPC, rswm_q)\nhead(localMI)\n\n            Ii          E.Ii       Var.Ii

Moran’s I map, it is wise to append the local Moran’s I dataframe (i.e. localMI) onto hunan SpatialPolygonDataFrame. The code chunks below can be used to perform the task. The out SpatialPolygonDataFrame is called hunan.localMI.\n\nhunan.localMI &lt;- cbind(hunan,localMI) %&gt;%\n  rename(Pr.Ii = Pr.z....E.Ii..)\n\n\n\n\nUsing choropleth mapping functions of tmap package, we can plot the local Moran’s I values by using the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Ii\", \n          style = \"pretty\",\n          palette = \"RdBu\",\n          title = \"local moran statistics\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choropleth shows there is evidence for both positive and negative Ii values. However, it is useful to consider the p-values for each of these values, as considered above.\nThe code chunk below produce a choropleth map of Moran’s I p-values by using functions of tmap package.\n\ntm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Pr.Ii\", \n          breaks=c(-Inf, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, Inf),\n          palette=\"-Blues\", \n          title = \"local Moran's I p-values\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor effective interpretation, it is better to plot both the local Moran’s I values map and its corresponding p-values map next to each other.\nThe code chunk below will be used to create such visualisation.\n\nlocalMI.map &lt;- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Ii\", \n          style = \"pretty\", \n          title = \"local moran statistics\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\npvalue.map &lt;- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Pr.Ii\", \n          breaks=c(-Inf, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, Inf),\n          palette=\"-Blues\", \n          title = \"local Moran's I p-values\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\ntmap_arrange(localMI.map, pvalue.map, asp=1, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LISA Cluster Map shows the significant locations color coded by type of spatial autocorrelation. The first step before we can generate the LISA cluster map is to plot the Moran scatterplot.\n\n\nThe Moran scatterplot is an illustration of the relationship between the values of the chosen attribute at each location and the average value of the same attribute at neighboring locations.\nThe code chunk below plots the Moran scatterplot of GDPPC 2012 by using moran.plot() of spdep.\n\nnci &lt;- moran.plot(hunan$GDPPC, rswm_q,\n                  labels=as.character(hunan$County), \n                  xlab=\"GDPPC 2012\", \n                  ylab=\"Spatially Lag GDPPC 2012\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the plot is split in 4 quadrants. The top right corner belongs to areas that have high GDPPC and are surrounded by other areas that have the average level of GDPPC. These are the high-high locations in the lesson slides.\n\n\n\nFirst we will use scale() to center and scale the variable. Here centering is done by subtracting the mean (omitting NAs) of the corresponding columns, and scaling is done by dividing the (centered) variable by their standard deviations.\n\nhunan$Z.GDPPC &lt;- scale(hunan$GDPPC) %&gt;% \n  as.vector \n\nThe as.vector() added to the end is to make sure that the data type we get out of this is a vector, that maps neatly into out dataframe.\nNow, we are ready to plot the Moran scatterplot again by using the code chunk below.\n\nnci2 &lt;- moran.plot(hunan$Z.GDPPC, rswm_q,\n                   labels=as.character(hunan$County),\n                   xlab=\"z-GDPPC 2012\", \n                   ylab=\"Spatially Lag z-GDPPC 2012\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below show the steps to prepare a LISA cluster map.\n\nquadrant &lt;- vector(mode=\"numeric\",length=nrow(localMI))\n\nNext, we derive the spatially lagged variable of interest (i.e. GDPPC) and center the spatially lagged variable around its mean.\n\nhunan$lag_GDPPC &lt;- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)\nDV &lt;- hunan$lag_GDPPC - mean(hunan$lag_GDPPC)     \n\nThis is follow by centering the local Moran’s around the mean.\n\nLM_I &lt;- localMI[,1] - mean(localMI[,1])    \n\nNext, we will set a statistical significance level for the local Moran.\n\nsignif &lt;- 0.05       \n\nThese four command lines define the low-low (1), low-high (2), high-low (3) and high-high (4) categories:\n\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 1\nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 2\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 3  \nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 4      \n\nLastly, we place non-significant Moran in the category 0:\n\nquadrant[localMI[,5]&gt;signif] &lt;- 0\n\nIn fact, we can combined all the steps into one single code chunk as shown below:\n\nquadrant &lt;- vector(mode=\"numeric\",length=nrow(localMI))\nhunan$lag_GDPPC &lt;- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)\nDV &lt;- hunan$lag_GDPPC - mean(hunan$lag_GDPPC)     \nLM_I &lt;- localMI[,1]   \nsignif &lt;- 0.05       \nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 1\nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 2\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 3  \nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 4    \nquadrant[localMI[,5]&gt;signif] &lt;- 0\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can build the LISA map by using the code chunk below.\n\nhunan.localMI$quadrant &lt;- quadrant\ncolors &lt;- c(\"#ffffff\", \"#2c7bb6\", \"#abd9e9\", \"#fdae61\", \"#d7191c\")\nclusters &lt;- c(\"insignificant\", \"low-low\", \"low-high\", \"high-low\", \"high-high\")\n\ntm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"quadrant\", \n          style = \"cat\", \n          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1], \n          labels = clusters[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],\n          popup.vars = c(\"\")) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,17)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor effective interpretation, it is better to plot both the local Moran’s I values map and its corresponding p-values map next to each other.\nThe code chunk below will be used to create such visualisation.\n\ngdppc &lt;- qtm(hunan, \"GDPPC\")\n\nhunan.localMI$quadrant &lt;- quadrant\ncolors &lt;- c(\"#ffffff\", \"#2c7bb6\", \"#abd9e9\", \"#fdae61\", \"#d7191c\")\nclusters &lt;- c(\"insignificant\", \"low-low\", \"low-high\", \"high-low\", \"high-high\")\n\nLISAmap &lt;- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"quadrant\", \n          style = \"cat\", \n          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1], \n          labels = clusters[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],\n          popup.vars = c(\"\")) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,17)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\ntmap_arrange(gdppc, LISAmap, \n             asp=1, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also include the local Moran’s I map and p-value map as shown below for easy comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside detecting cluster and outliers, localised spatial statistics can be also used to detect hot spot and/or cold spot areas.\nThe term ‘hot spot’ has been used generically across disciplines to describe a region or value that is higher relative to its surroundings (Lepers et al 2005, Aben et al 2012, Isobe et al 2015).\n\n\nAn alternative spatial statistics to detect spatial anomalies is the Getis and Ord’s G-statistics (Getis and Ord, 1972; Ord and Getis, 1995). It looks at neighbours within a defined proximity to identify where either high or low values cluster spatially. Here, statistically significant hot-spots are recognised as areas of high values where other areas within a neighbourhood range also share high values too.\nThe analysis consists of three steps:\n\nDeriving spatial weight matrix\nComputing Gi statistics\nMapping Gi statistics\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we need to define a new set of neighbours. Whist the spatial autocorrelation considered units which shared borders, for Getis-Ord we are defining neighbours based on distance.\nThere are two type of distance-based proximity matrix, they are:\n\nfixed distance weight matrix; and\nadaptive distance weight matrix.\n\n\n\n\nWe will need points to associate with each polygon before we can make our connectivity graph. It will be a little more complicated than just running st_centroid() on the sf object: us.bound. We need the coordinates in a separate data frame for this to work.\nTo do this we will use a mapping function. The mapping function applies a given function to each element of a vector and returns a vector of the same length. Our input vector will be the geometry column of us.bound. Our function will be st_centroid(). We will be using map_dbl variation of map from the purrr package. For more documentation, check out map documentation\nTo get our longitude values we map the st_centroid() function over the geometry column of us.bound and access the longitude value through double bracket notation [[]] and 1. This allows us to get only the longitude, which is the first value in each centroid.\n\nlongitude &lt;- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])\n\nWe do the same for latitude with one key difference. We access the second value per each centroid with [[2]].\n\nlatitude &lt;- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])\n\nNow that we have latitude and longitude, we use cbind to put longitude and latitude into the same object.\n\ncoords &lt;- cbind(longitude, latitude)\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, we need to determine the upper limit for distance band by using the steps below:\n\nReturn a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours of each other by using knearneigh() of spdep.\nConvert the knn object returned by knearneigh() into a neighbours list of class nb with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using knn2nb().\nReturn the length of neighbour relationship edges by using nbdists() of spdep. The function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, in km otherwise.\nRemove the list structure of the returned object by using unlist().\n\n\n#coords &lt;- coordinates(hunan)\nk1 &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))\nk1dists &lt;- unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE))\nsummary(k1dists)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Max. \n  24.79   32.57   38.01   39.07   44.52   61.79 \n\n\nThe summary report shows that the largest first nearest neighbour distance is 61.79 km, so using this as the upper threshold gives certainty that all units will have at least one neighbour.\n\n\n\nNow, we will compute the distance weight matrix by using dnearneigh() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nwm_d62 &lt;- dnearneigh(coords, 0, 62, longlat = TRUE)\nwm_d62\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 324 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 4.183884 \nAverage number of links: 3.681818 \n\n\nNext, nb2listw() is used to convert the nb object into spatial weights object.\n\nwm62_lw &lt;- nb2listw(wm_d62, style = 'B')\nsummary(wm62_lw)\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 324 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 4.183884 \nAverage number of links: 3.681818 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6 \n 6 15 14 26 20  7 \n6 least connected regions:\n6 15 30 32 56 65 with 1 link\n7 most connected regions:\n21 28 35 45 50 52 82 with 6 links\n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn  S0  S1   S2\nB 88 7744 324 648 5440\n\n\nThe output spatial weights object is called wm62_lw.\n\n\n\nOne of the characteristics of fixed distance weight matrix is that more densely settled areas (usually the urban areas) tend to have more neighbours and the less densely settled areas (usually the rural counties) tend to have lesser neighbours. Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.\nIt is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using k-nearest neighbours, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nknn &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=8))\nknn\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 704

In this sense, they are not summary statistics but scores that allow us to learn more about the spatial structure in our data. The general intuition behind the metrics however is similar to that of global ones. Some of them are even mathematically connected, where the global version can be decomposed into a collection of local ones. One such example is Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA). Beside LISA, Getis-Ord’s Gi-statistics will be introduce as an alternative LMSA statistics that present complementary information or allow us to obtain similar insights for geographically referenced data.\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will compute Local Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation (LMSA) using spdep package.

    "text": "Local Indicators of Spatial Association or LISA are statistics that evaluate the existence of clusters and/or outliers in the spatial arrangement of a given variable. For instance if we are studying distribution of GDP per capita of Hunan Provice, People Republic of China, local clusters in GDP per capita mean that there are counties that have higher or lower rates than is to be expected by chance alone; that is, the values occurring are above or below those of a random distribution in space.\nIn this section, we will apply appropriate Local Indicators for Spatial Association (LISA), especially local Moran’s I to detect cluster and/or outlier from GDP per capita 2012 of Hunan Province, PRC.\n\n\nBefore we can compute the global spatial autocorrelation statistics, we need to construct spatial weights of the study area. The spatial weights is used to define the neighbourhood relationships between the geographical units (i.e. county) in the study area.\nIn the code chunk below, poly2nb() of spdep package is used to compute contiguity weight matrices for the study area. This function builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries. Based on the documentation, note that the “queen” argument can take TRUE or FALSE as options. If not specified, the default is set to TRUE and the function will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen criteria (which is on the basis of shared boundaries):\nThe code chunk below is used to compute Queen contiguity weight matrix:\n\nwm_q &lt;- poly2nb(hunan,\n                queen = TRUE)\n\nsummary(wm_q)\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 11 \n 2  2 12 16 24 14 11  4  2  1 \n2 least connected regions:\n30 65 with 1 link\n1 most connected region:\n85 with 11 links\n\n\nThe summary report shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connected area unit has 11 neighbours and there are two ara units with only one neighbour.\n\n\n\nNext, we need to assign weights to each neighboring polygon. In our case, each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style=“W”). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summarise the neighbors’ values, it has one drawback in that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data. For this example, we’ll stick with the style=“W” option for simplicity’s sake but note that other more robust options are available, notably style=“B”.\n\nrswm_q &lt;- nb2listw(wm_q,\n                   style = \"W\",\n                   zero.policy = TRUE)\nrswm_q\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn S0       S1       S2\nW 88 7744 88 37.86334 365.9147\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we learn from the code chunk above?\n\n\n\n\nThe input of nb2listw() must be an object of class nb. The syntax of the function has two major arguments, namely style and zero.policy.\nstyle can take values “W”, “B”, “C”, “U”, “minmax” and “S”.\n\nB is the basic binary coding\nW is row standardised (sums over all links to n)\nC is globally standardised (sums over all links to n)\nU is equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity)\nS is the variance-stabilizing coding scheme proposed by Tiefelsdorf et al. 1999, p. 167-168 (sums over all links to n).\n\nIf zero policy is set to TRUE, weights vectors of zero length are inserted for regions without neighbour in the neighbours list. These will in turn generate lag values of zero, equivalent to the sum of products of the zero row t(rep(0, length=length(neighbours))) %*% x, for arbitrary numerical vector x of length length(neighbours). The spatially lagged value of x for the zero-neighbour region will then be zero, which may (or may not) be a sensible choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo compute local Moran’s I, the localmoran() function of spdep will be used. It computes Ii values, given a set of zi values and a listw object providing neighbour weighting information for the polygon associated with the zi values.\nThe code chunks below are used to compute local Moran’s I of GDPPC2012 at the county level.\n\nfips &lt;- order(hunan$County)\nlocalMI &lt;- localmoran(hunan$GDPPC, rswm_q)\nhead(localMI)\n\n            Ii          E.Ii       Var.Ii

    "text": "The LISA Cluster Map shows the significant locations color coded by type of spatial autocorrelation. The first step before we can generate the LISA cluster map is to plot the Moran scatterplot.\n\n\nThe Moran scatterplot is an illustration of the relationship between the values of the chosen attribute at each location and the average value of the same attribute at neighboring locations.\nThe code chunk below plots the Moran scatterplot of GDPPC 2012 by using moran.plot() of spdep.\n\nnci &lt;- moran.plot(hunan$GDPPC, rswm_q,\n                  labels=as.character(hunan$County), \n                  xlab=\"GDPPC 2012\", \n                  ylab=\"Spatially Lag GDPPC 2012\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the plot is split in 4 quadrants. The top right corner belongs to areas that have high GDPPC and are surrounded by other areas that have the average level of GDPPC. These are the high-high locations in the lesson slides.\n\n\n\nFirst we will use scale() to center and scale the variable. Here centering is done by subtracting the mean (omitting NAs) of the corresponding columns, and scaling is done by dividing the (centered) variable by their standard deviations.\n\nhunan$Z.GDPPC &lt;- scale(hunan$GDPPC) %&gt;% \n  as.vector \n\nThe as.vector() added to the end is to make sure that the data type we get out of this is a vector, that maps neatly into out dataframe.\nNow, we are ready to plot the Moran scatterplot again by using the code chunk below.\n\nnci2 &lt;- moran.plot(hunan$Z.GDPPC, rswm_q,\n                   labels=as.character(hunan$County),\n                   xlab=\"z-GDPPC 2012\", \n                   ylab=\"Spatially Lag z-GDPPC 2012\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below show the steps to prepare a LISA cluster map.\n\nquadrant &lt;- vector(mode=\"numeric\",length=nrow(localMI))\n\nNext, we derive the spatially lagged variable of interest (i.e. GDPPC) and center the spatially lagged variable around its mean.\n\nhunan$lag_GDPPC &lt;- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)\nDV &lt;- hunan$lag_GDPPC - mean(hunan$lag_GDPPC)     \n\nThis is follow by centering the local Moran’s around the mean.\n\nLM_I &lt;- localMI[,1] - mean(localMI[,1])    \n\nNext, we will set a statistical significance level for the local Moran.\n\nsignif &lt;- 0.05       \n\nThese four command lines define the low-low (1), low-high (2), high-low (3) and high-high (4) categories:\n\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 1\nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 2\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 3  \nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 4      \n\nLastly, we place non-significant Moran in the category 0:\n\nquadrant[localMI[,5]&gt;signif] &lt;- 0\n\nIn fact, we can combined all the steps into one single code chunk as shown below:\n\nquadrant &lt;- vector(mode=\"numeric\",length=nrow(localMI))\nhunan$lag_GDPPC &lt;- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)\nDV &lt;- hunan$lag_GDPPC - mean(hunan$lag_GDPPC)     \nLM_I &lt;- localMI[,1]   \nsignif &lt;- 0.05       \nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 1\nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 2\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 3  \nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 4    \nquadrant[localMI[,5]&gt;signif] &lt;- 0\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can build the LISA map by using the code chunk below.\n\nhunan.localMI$quadrant &lt;- quadrant\ncolors &lt;- c(\"#ffffff\", \"#2c7bb6\", \"#abd9e9\", \"#fdae61\", \"#d7191c\")\nclusters &lt;- c(\"insignificant\", \"low-low\", \"low-high\", \"high-low\", \"high-high\")\n\ntm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"quadrant\", \n          style = \"cat\", \n          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1], \n          labels = clusters[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],\n          popup.vars = c(\"\")) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,17)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor effective interpretation, it is better to plot both the local Moran’s I values map and its corresponding p-values map next to each other.\nThe code chunk below will be used to create such visualisation.\n\ngdppc &lt;- qtm(hunan, \"GDPPC\")\n\nhunan.localMI$quadrant &lt;- quadrant\ncolors &lt;- c(\"#ffffff\", \"#2c7bb6\", \"#abd9e9\", \"#fdae61\", \"#d7191c\")\nclusters &lt;- c(\"insignificant\", \"low-low\", \"low-high\", \"high-low\", \"high-high\")\n\nLISAmap &lt;- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"quadrant\", \n          style = \"cat\", \n          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1], \n          labels = clusters[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],\n          popup.vars = c(\"\")) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,17)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\ntmap_arrange(gdppc, LISAmap, \n             asp=1, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also include the local Moran’s I map and p-value map as shown below for easy comparison."

    "text": "Beside detecting cluster and outliers, localised spatial statistics can be also used to detect hot spot and/or cold spot areas.\nThe term ‘hot spot’ has been used generically across disciplines to describe a region or value that is higher relative to its surroundings (Lepers et al 2005, Aben et al 2012, Isobe et al 2015).\n\n\nAn alternative spatial statistics to detect spatial anomalies is the Getis and Ord’s G-statistics (Getis and Ord, 1972; Ord and Getis, 1995). It looks at neighbours within a defined proximity to identify where either high or low values cluster spatially. Here, statistically significant hot-spots are recognised as areas of high values where other areas within a neighbourhood range also share high values too.\nThe analysis consists of three steps:\n\nDeriving spatial weight matrix\nComputing Gi statistics\nMapping Gi statistics\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we need to define a new set of neighbours. Whist the spatial autocorrelation considered units which shared borders, for Getis-Ord we are defining neighbours based on distance.\nThere are two type of distance-based proximity matrix, they are:\n\nfixed distance weight matrix; and\nadaptive distance weight matrix.\n\n\n\n\nWe will need points to associate with each polygon before we can make our connectivity graph. It will be a little more complicated than just running st_centroid() on the sf object: us.bound. We need the coordinates in a separate data frame for this to work.\nTo do this we will use a mapping function. The mapping function applies a given function to each element of a vector and returns a vector of the same length. Our input vector will be the geometry column of us.bound. Our function will be st_centroid(). We will be using map_dbl variation of map from the purrr package. For more documentation, check out map documentation\nTo get our longitude values we map the st_centroid() function over the geometry column of us.bound and access the longitude value through double bracket notation [[]] and 1. This allows us to get only the longitude, which is the first value in each centroid.\n\nlongitude &lt;- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])\n\nWe do the same for latitude with one key difference. We access the second value per each centroid with [[2]].\n\nlatitude &lt;- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])\n\nNow that we have latitude and longitude, we use cbind to put longitude and latitude into the same object.\n\ncoords &lt;- cbind(longitude, latitude)\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, we need to determine the upper limit for distance band by using the steps below:\n\nReturn a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours of each other by using knearneigh() of spdep.\nConvert the knn object returned by knearneigh() into a neighbours list of class nb with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using knn2nb().\nReturn the length of neighbour relationship edges by using nbdists() of spdep. The function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, in km otherwise.\nRemove the list structure of the returned object by using unlist().\n\n\n#coords &lt;- coordinates(hunan)\nk1 &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))\nk1dists &lt;- unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE))\nsummary(k1dists)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Max. \n  24.79   32.57   38.01   39.07   44.52   61.79 \n\n\nThe summary report shows that the largest first nearest neighbour distance is 61.79 km, so using this as the upper threshold gives certainty that all units will have at least one neighbour.\n\n\n\nNow, we will compute the distance weight matrix by using dnearneigh() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nwm_d62 &lt;- dnearneigh(coords, 0, 62, longlat = TRUE)\nwm_d62\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 324 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 4.183884 \nAverage number of links: 3.681818 \n\n\nNext, nb2listw() is used to convert the nb object into spatial weights object.\n\nwm62_lw &lt;- nb2listw(wm_d62, style = 'B')\nsummary(wm62_lw)\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 324 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 4.183884 \nAverage number of links: 3.681818 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6 \n 6 15 14 26 20  7 \n6 least connected regions:\n6 15 30 32 56 65 with 1 link\n7 most connected regions:\n21 28 35 45 50 52 82 with 6 links\n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn  S0  S1   S2\nB 88 7744 324 648 5440\n\n\nThe output spatial weights object is called wm62_lw.\n\n\n\nOne of the characteristics of fixed distance weight matrix is that more densely settled areas (usually the urban areas) tend to have more neighbours and the less densely settled areas (usually the rural counties) tend to have lesser neighbours. Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.\nIt is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using k-nearest neighbours, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nknn &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=8))\nknn\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 704 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 9.090909 \nAverage number of links: 8 \nNon-symmetric neighbours list\n\n\nNext, nb2listw() is used to convert the nb object into spatial weights object.\n\nknn_lw &lt;- nb2listw(knn, style = 'B')\nsummary(knn_lw)\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 704 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 9.090909 \nAverage number of links: 8 \nNon-symmetric neighbours list\nLink number distribution:\n\n 8 \n88 \n88 least connected regions:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 with 8 links\n88 most connected regions:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 with 8 links\n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn  S0   S1    S2\nB 88 7744 704 1300 23014"

However, for the other provinces, the difference is not so obvious and it seems like the occurrences of road accidents are more well spread out across the week. This could be explained by Bangkok being a prime tourist destination and major urban centre, and it could attract a greater crowd from within and outside of Thailand over the weekend, hence leading to greater traffic on the road and higher chances of road accidents occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverallBreakdown by province\n\n\n\nggplot(roadacc, aes(x = inc_time)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \"slategrey\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, 1))+\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Road Accidents by Time of Day\", \n       x = \"Time of Day\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1,size = 8))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the chart, it is observed that road accidents occur more often between 7am to 11pm as compared to 12 midnight to 6am. This could be explained by 7am to 11pm being the time when most are awake for their daily activities and the roads are likely to have higher activity, which result in higher chances of occurrences of road accidents. The top two timings at which road accidents occur are at 9am and 7pm and this could be explained by it being the peak hour at which the general population i.e. workers, school students get to and get off work and school.\n\n\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(roadacc, aes(x = inc_time)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \"slategrey\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, 1))+\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Road Accidents by Time of Day\", \n       x = \"Time of Day\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  facet_wrap(~province_en, scales = \"fixed\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1,size = 8))\n\nggplotly(p1)\n\n\n\n\n\nBangkok, Samut Prakan and Pathum Thani also seem to follow the general observation seen under the overall chart for occurrences of road accidents by time day i.e. road accidents generally occur more during 7am to 11pm and peak timings are during the going to and getting off work/school hours at around 9am and 7pm.

However, for the other provinces, the difference is not so obvious and it seems like the occurrences of road accidents are more well spread out across the week. This could be explained by Bangkok being a prime tourist destination and major urban centre, and it could attract a greater crowd from within and outside of Thailand over the weekend, hence leading to greater traffic on the road and higher chances of road accidents occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverallBreakdown by province\n\n\n\nggplot(roadacc, aes(x = inc_time)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \"slategrey\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, 1))+\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Road Accidents by Time of Day\", \n       x = \"Time of Day\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1,size = 8))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the chart, it is observed that road accidents occur more often between 7am to 11pm as compared to 12 midnight to 6am. This could be explained by 7am to 11pm being the time when most are awake for their daily activities and the roads are likely to have higher activity, which result in higher chances of occurrences of road accidents. The top two timings at which road accidents occur are at 9am and 7pm and this could be explained by it being the peak hour at which the general population i.e. workers, school students get to and get off work and school.\n\n\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(roadacc, aes(x = inc_time)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \"slategrey\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, 1))+\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Road Accidents by Time of Day\", \n       x = \"Time of Day\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  facet_wrap(~province_en, scales = \"fixed\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1,size = 8))\n\nggplotly(p1)\n\n\n\n\n\nBangkok, Samut Prakan and Pathum Thani also seem to follow the general observation seen under the overall chart for occurrences of road accidents by time day i.e. road accidents generally occur more during 7am to 11pm and peak timings are during the going to and getting off work/school hours at around 9am and 7pm.

However, for the other provinces, the difference is not so obvious and it seems like the occurrences of road accidents are more well spread out across the week. This could be explained by Bangkok being a prime tourist destination and major urban centre, and it could attract a greater crowd from within and outside of Thailand over the weekend, hence leading to greater traffic on the road and higher chances of road accidents occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverallBreakdown by province\n\n\n\nggplot(roadacc, aes(x = inc_time)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \"slategrey\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, 1))+\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Road Accidents by Time of Day\", \n       x = \"Time of Day\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1,size = 8))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the chart, it is observed that road accidents occur more often between 7am to 11pm as compared to 12 midnight to 6am. This could be explained by 7am to 11pm being the time when most are awake for their daily activities and the roads are likely to have higher activity, which result in higher chances of occurrences of road accidents. The top two timings at which road accidents occur are at 9am and 7pm and this could be explained by it being the peak hour at which the general population i.e. workers, school students get to and get off work and school.\n\n\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(roadacc, aes(x = inc_time)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \"slategrey\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, 1))+\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Road Accidents by Time of Day\", \n       x = \"Time of Day\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  facet_wrap(~province_en, scales = \"fixed\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1,size = 8))\n\nggplotly(p1)\n\n\n\n\n\nBangkok, Samut Prakan and Pathum Thani also seem to follow the general observation seen under the overall chart for occurrences of road accidents by time day i.e. road accidents generally occur more during 7am to 11pm and peak timings are during the going to and getting off work/school hours at around 9am and 7pm.

    "text": "According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), road traffic accidents cause the death of approximately 1.19 million people each year and leave between 20 to 50 million people with non-fatal injuries. Vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists, make up more than half of all road traffic deaths.\nRoad traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5 to 29, however two-thirds of road traffic fatalities occur among people of working ages, from 18 to 59 years. Further, nine in 10 fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these countries make up only around 60% of the world’s vehicles.\nBesides human suffering, road traffic injuries also result in a heavy economic burden on victims and their families, through treatment costs for the injured and loss of productivity of those killed or disabled. More broadly, road traffic injuries have a serious impact on national economies, costing countries 3% of their annual gross domestic product.\nAccording to the WHO, Thailand’s roads are the deadliest in Southeast Asia and among the worst in the world - about 20,000 people die in road accidents each year, or about 56 deaths a day.\nBetween 2014 and 2021, Thailand experienced a notable increase in accident frequencies. Specifically, 19% of all accidents in Thailand occurred on the national highways, which make up the primary public thoroughfares connecting various regions, provinces, districts, and significant locations within a comprehensive network. Within the broader context of accidents across the country, there existed a considerable 66% likelihood of encountering accident-prone zones, often termed as ‘black spots’ which are distributed as follows: 66% on straight road segments, 13% at curves, 6% at median points of cross-shaped intersections, 5% at T-shaped intersections and Y-shaped intersections, 3% at cross-shaped intersections, 2% on bridges, and 2% on steep slopes.\n\n\n\nBy and large, road traffic accidents can be attributed by two major factors, namely behavioural and environmental factors.\n\nBehavioural factors in driving are considered to be major causes of traffic accidents either in direct or indirect manner (Lewin, 1982). These factors can be further grouped into driver behavior (driver/driving style) and driver performance (driver/driving skills) (Elander, West, & French, 1993).\nEnvironmental factors, on the other hand, includes but not limited to weather conditions such as poor visibility during heavy rain or fogs as well as road conditions such as sharp bends, slippery slopes, and blind spots.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated the significant potential of Spatial Point Patterns Analysis (SPPA) in exploring and identifying factors influencing road traffic accidents. However, these studies often focus solely on either behavioral or environmental factors, with limited consideration of temporal factors such as season, day of the week, or time of day.\nIn view of this, in this hands-on exercise, we will determine factors that affect road traffic accidents in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) by employing both spatial and spatio-temporal point patterns analysis methods.\nThe specific objectives are as follows:\n\nTo visualize the spatio-temporal dynamics of road traffic accidents in BMR using appropriate statistical graphics and geovisualization methods.\nTo conduct detailed spatial analysis of road traffic accidents using appropriate Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods.\nTo conduct detailed spatio-temporal analysis of road traffic accidents using appropriate Temporal Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods.\n\n\n\n\nKey packages that are installed are:\n\nsf for importing, managing, and processing vector-based geospatial data, and\nspatstat, which has a wide range of useful functions for point pattern analysis. In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to perform 1st- and 2nd-order spatial point patterns analysis and derive kernel density estimation (KDE) layer\nraster which reads, writes, manipulates, analyses and model of gridded spatial data (i.e. raster). In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to convert image output generate by spatstat into raster format.\nmaptools which provides a set of tools for manipulating geographic data. In this hands-on exercise, we mainly use it to convert Spatial objects into ppp format of spatstat.\ntmap which provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps by using leaflet API.\ntidyverse for performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling and visualising data.\nspNetwork which provides functions to perform Spatial Point Patterns Analysis such as kernel density estimation (KDE) and K-function on network. It can also be used to build spatial matrices (`listw’ objects like in ‘spdep’ package) to conduct any kind of traditional spatial analysis with spatial weights based on reticular distances.\n\nThe packages are loaded with the following code chunk:\n\npacman::p_load(sf,spatstat,raster,maptools,tmap,tidyverse,spNetwork,DT,forcats,ggthemes,plotly)\n\nFor any simulation steps carried out in this exercise, we set a seed to ensure reproducibility:\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, three basic data sets are used:\n\nThailand Road Accident [2019-2022] on Kaggle - comprised records of road accidents in Thailand from ~2019 to 2022, based on information provided by the Office of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transport.\nThailand - Subnational Administrative Boundaries on HDX\nThailand Roads (OpenStreetMap Export) on HDX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data is imported using the code below:\n\nroadacc &lt;- read_csv(\"data/rawdata/thai_road_accident_2019_2022.csv\")\n\nTaking a glimpse at the data to determine the fields in the data:\n\nglimpse(roadacc)\n\nThere are 81735 rows and 18 variables. Further details about the important variables that would be needed for analysis can be found in the dropdown box below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore information about variables for analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\nPurpose of data i.e. what it might indicate\n\n\n\n\nincident_datetime\nThe date and time of the accident occurrence\nwhether accidents tend to occur at specific:\n\nmonths\nday of week\ntime of the day\n\n\n\nreport_datetime\nThe date and time when the accident was reported\nefficacy at which accident was reported could indicate:\n\nhow busy the road segment is\nhow tightly the road is being monitored/ whether there is a lapse in the management of the road\n\n\n\nprovince_en\nThe name of the province in Thailand, written in English\nsupports the filtering of data to just BMR\n\n\nagency\nThe government agency responsible for the road and traffic management\npinpoints the responsible government agency, could indicate whether there is a need for government agency to take corrective actions\n\n\nroute\nThe route or road segment where the accident occurred\nwhile the data can be used to determine frequency of incident at different locations, it is not useful for our case as it’s in the Thai language\n\n\nvehicle_type\nThe type of vehicle involved in the accident\ncan determine frequency of vehicle types involved in accidents\n\n\npresumed_cause\nThe presumed cause or reason for the accident\ncan determine distribution of cause for accidents\n\n\naccident_type\nThe type or nature of the accident\ncan determine distribution of nature of accidents\n\n\nnumber_of_vehicles_involved\nThe number of vehicles involved in the accident\ncan determine the scale of accidents at different locations i.e. how severe/deadly\n\n\nnumber_of_fatalities\nThe number of fatalities resulting from the accident\ncan determine the scale of accidents at different locations i.e. how severe/deadly\n\n\nnumber_of_injuries\nThe number of injuries resulting from the accident\ncan determine the scale of accidents at different locations i.e. how severe/deadly\n\n\nweather_condition\nThe weather condition at the time of the accident\ncan determine how much weather conditions can affect the occurrence of accidents\n\n\nlatitude\nThe latitude coordinate of the accident location\nused for mapping and for analysis with other datasets\n\n\nlongitude\nThe longitude coordinate of the accident location\nused for mapping and for analysis with other datasets\n\n\nroad_description\nThe description of the road type or configuration where the accident occurred\ncan determine how road types can affect the occurrence of accidents\n\n\nslope_description\nThe description of the slope condition at the accident location\ncan determine how presence of slopes can affect the occurrence of accidents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will first drop “province_th” as it indicates the provinces in the Thai language.\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc[, !names(roadacc) %in% c(\"province_th\",\"route\")]\n\n\n\n\nWe then determine the unique provinces within the dataset and scan through the province names (i.e. in case there are any entries that refer to the same province but are spelt differently/have spelling mistakes) before filtering the data to just include provinces that are within the BMR:\n\nunique_provinces &lt;- roadacc %&gt;% \n  distinct(province_en) %&gt;%\n  arrange(province_en)\n\nBased on observations, there were no spelling mistakes. As such we can proceed with filtering the data to keep our region of interest which comprises Bangkok and five adjacent provinces of Nakhon Pathom, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, Samut Prakan and Samut Sakhon:\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;% \n  filter(province_en %in% c(\"Bangkok\", \"Nakhon Pathom\", \"Nonthaburi\", \"Pathum Thani\",\"Samut Prakan\",\"Samut Sakhon\"))\n\nThis leaves the data with 13336 rows.\n\n\n\nWe further clean the data by removing rows with missing data:\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  drop_na()\n\n\n\n\nWe also check if there are duplicate entries in the dataset:\n\nroadacc$acc_code[duplicated(roadacc$acc_code) == TRUE]\n\nThere are no duplicate entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\nDuring class, Prof Kam had advised to study the data carefully and shared that it was important to filter out data with incomplete coordinates (missing either longitude or latitude or both) and shared that one way to do it was via the code below:\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(longitude) & longitude != \"\",\n         !is.na(latitude) & latitude != \"\")\n\nAs with the drop_na() code above, this way will also leave just 12986 rows of data as the missing data were found in either the longitude or latitude variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe convert roadacc data frame into a simple feature data frame and also transform the data from geographic coordinate system (EPSG: 4326 WGS84 Geographic Coordinate System) to projected coordinate system:\n\nroadacc &lt;- st_as_sf(roadacc, \n                    coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"),\n                    crs=4326) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs = 32647)\n\nBased on the summary statistics of roadacc above, it is noted that the minimum longitude is 99.85° and maximum longitude is 100.94°. While there are 2 possible projected coordinate systems for Thailand, EPSG 32647 and 32648, the appropriate projected coordinate system to transform the data to would be EPSG 32647 as the minimum and maximum longitude of roadacc falls within EPSG 32467’s area of use (between 96°E and 102°E). A comparison of the area of use for both projected coordinate systems is shown below:\n\n\n\n\nEPSG 32647\nEPSG 32648\n\n\n\n\nArea of use\nBetween 96°E and 102°E, northern hemisphere between equator and 84°N, onshore and offshore. China. Indonesia. Laos. Malaysia - West Malaysia. Mongolia. Myanmar (Burma). Russian Federation. Thailand.\nBetween 102°E and 108°E, northern hemisphere between equator and 84°N, onshore and offshore. Cambodia. China. Indonesia. Laos. Malaysia - West Malaysia. Mongolia. Russian Federation. Singapore. Thailand. Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe incident_datetime and report_datetime variables are in datetime field, we hence utilise these variables and the lubridate() function to generate new variables that represent:\n\nmonth: “inc_month”\nday of week: “inc_dayofweek”\ntime of day: “inc_time”\n\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  mutate(inc_year = year(incident_datetime)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(inc_month = month(incident_datetime,\n                       label = TRUE,\n                       abbr = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(inc_dayofweek = wday(incident_datetime,\n                              week_start = getOption(\"lubridate.week.start\", 1),\n                              label = TRUE,\n                              abbr = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(inc_time = hour(incident_datetime))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\nNote that we can generate month in numbers or in factor format via:\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month_num = month(incident_datetime)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month_fac = month(incident_datetime,\n                       label = TRUE,\n                       abbr = TRUE))\n\n\n\nWe also determine the gap between the incident time and reporting time and create a new variable “timegap” in hours unit:\n\nroadacc$timegap &lt;- time_length(roadacc$report_datetime - roadacc$incident_datetime, \"hours\")\n\nLogically, the date and time when the accident was reported should be after the date and time of the accident occurrence. Looking at the summary statistics below, there are data entries that could have been erroneously recorded resulting in a negative time gap between report time and incident time (i.e. report time was earlier than incident time). As such, the data was further filtered to remove erroneous data to avoid affecting the analysis:\n\nsummary(roadacc$timegap)\n\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  filter(timegap &gt;= 0)\n\nThis leaves us with 12985 rows.\n\n\n\nWe then save this cleaned data as a rds file:\n\nwrite_rds(roadacc,\"data/rds/roadacc.rds\")\n\n\nroadacc &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/roadacc.rds\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\nIt is good practice to save cleaned file as a new rds file via write_rds() to avoid re-running the data cleaning and wrangling codes. write_rds() will take care of all the objects within the dataset. Once the file is saved, we can add “#| eval: false” to the data cleaning and wrangling codes to avoid re-running them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data has different files providing details of the administrative boundaries of Thailand at different administrative levels:\n\nLevel 0 (country)\nLevel 1 (province)\nLevel 2 (district)\nLevel 3 (sub-district, tambon)\n\nAs our area of interest is at Level 1 (province level), we will utilise “tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121” that reflects details at province levels and import the data using the code chunk below:\n\nprovincedata = st_read(dsn = \"data/rawdata\", \n                  layer = \"tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121\")\n\nWe note from the above that it is a multipolygon feature data frame. We note that there are 77 features and 16 fields, and the data is in WGS84 geographic coordinate system.\nWe then take a glimpse of the data:\n\nglimpse(provincedata)\n\n\n\n\nWe note from a glimpse of the data above that there are only a few pertinent fields that we require for our analysis, specifically:\n\nADM1_EN: province name in english\nShape_Leng\nShape_Area\ngeometry\n\nWe hence filter the data to only comprise these fields to make the data frame more manageable:\n\nprovincedata &lt;- provincedata %&gt;%\n  select(\"ADM1_EN\", \"Shape_Leng\",\"Shape_Area\",\"geometry\")\n\n\n\n\nWe also filter to keep only data that are relevant to our area of interest which is BMR:\n\nprovincedata &lt;- provincedata %&gt;% \n  filter(ADM1_EN %in% c(\"Bangkok\", \"Nakhon Pathom\", \"Nonthaburi\", \"Pathum Thani\",\"Samut Prakan\",\"Samut Sakhon\"))\n\nThis leaves 6 rows of data and 4 variables.\n\n\n\nFrom the code chunk below, it is noted that the EPSG code for the selectedboundaries data frame is EPSG: 4326:\n\nst_crs(provincedata)\n\nWe will need to reproject provincedata from EPSG code to EPSG: 32647 which is the projected coordinate system to use for BMR, our area of interest:\n\nprovincedata32647 &lt;- st_transform(provincedata, \n                              crs = 32647)\n\nWe check if the EPSG code has been correctly assigned:\n\nst_crs(provincedata32647)\n\n\n\n\nWe save this cleaned data as a rds file:\n\nwrite_rds(provincedata32647,\"data/rds/provincedata32647.rds\")\n\n\nprovincedata32647 &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/provincedata32647.rds\")\n\nWe visualise our provincedata32647:\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\ntm_shape(provincedata32647)+\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe import the data as follows:\n\nroadlines = st_read(dsn = \"data/rawdata\",\n                    layer = \"hotosm_tha_roads_lines_shp\")\n\nWe then glimpse at the data:\n\nglimpse(roadlines)\n\n\nst_geometry(roadlines)\n\nThe dataset is of the multilinestring geometry and is very large, with 2792590 rows and 15 variables but we only need to extract relevant information that lie within the BMR for analysis.\n\n\n\nBased on the code chunk below, it is noted that the coordinate system of the roadlines data is missing.\n\nst_crs(roadlines)\n\nBased on the values of the geometry in roadlines, the coordinates seem to be in geographic (latitude/longitude) form, in degrees, typically in a CRS like EPSG:4326 (WGS 84) used for global geographic coordinates. We hence assign the missing EPSG code using the code chunk below:\n\nroadlines4326 &lt;- st_set_crs(roadlines,4326)\n\nWe check the CRS using the code chunk below:\n\nst_crs(roadlines4326)\n\nFor analysis, we would eventually need to overlay the roadlines4326 data with the selectedboundaries32647 data to determine the roads that lie within BMR. In order to perform geoprocessing using two geospatial data, both geospatial data would need to be projected using similar coordinate systems - in this case, it its EPSG: 32647:\n\nroadlines32647 &lt;- st_transform(roadlines4326, crs = 32647)\n\nWe check the CRS code again:\n\nst_crs(roadlines32647)\n\n\n\n\nBased on the columns in the data frame roadlines32647, the columns that seem relevant/useful to retain for analysis are “highway”, “surface”, “smoothness”, “width”, “lanes”, “oneway”, “bridge” and “geometry”.\nHowever before going ahead to retain these variables, we determine the presence of missing data within roadlines32647:\n\nmissing_counts &lt;- sapply(roadlines32647, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))\nprint(missing_counts)\n\nBased on the result we obtained, more than 60% of data is missing for the variable “source” and more than 80% of data is missing for the variables “name”, “name_en”, “surface”, “smoothness”, “width”, “lanes”, “oneway”, “bridge”, “layer”, “source” and “name_th”. Given the extent of missing data, we will omit these columns as they would not provide useful information for analysis and only retain the relevant/useful columns “highway” and “geometry” with no missing data:\n\nselectedroadlines &lt;- roadlines32647 %&gt;%\n  select(\"highway\", \"geometry\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below is used to determine the types of highways in the selectedroadlines data frame:\n\nunique_highway &lt;- unique(selectedroadlines$highway)\nunique_highway &lt;- sort(unique_highway)\n\nunique_highway\n\nWhile there are several classes of highway, our analysis will focus on the major classes of highway as stated on Thailand Highway Classification, otherwise the map will be too overcrowded for analysis and we might also experience lags in rendering the Quarto document.\nA detailed explanation on the selected major highways is indicated in the table below:\n\n\n\nTypes of highway\nDetails\nIncluded for analysis?\n\n\n\n\nmotorway\nExpressway with full access control (source)\nYes\n\n\nprimary\nTop-level urban road across the city connecting trunk to trunk, or road of equal or greater importance than the primary intercity highway that runs through that city (source)\nYes\n\n\nsecondary\nMain urban road connecting primary to primary or higher, or road of equal or greater importance than the secondary intercity highway that runs through that city. Based on table above, motorcars, motorcycles and pedestrians all have access (source)\nYes\n\n\ntertiary\nRoads that are more important than regular unclassified or residential roads, or roads that connect several unclassified or residential roads. Based on table above, motorcars, motorcycles and pedestrians all have access (source)\nYes\n\n\ntrunk\nBased on table above, motorcars, motorcycles and pedestrians all have access (source)\nYes\n\n\n\n\nselectedroadlines &lt;- selectedroadlines %&gt;%\n  filter(highway %in% c(\"motorway\",\"primary\",\"secondary\",\"tertiary\",\"trunk\"))\n\n\n\n\nWe require only a subset of the selectedroadlines data to just roads within our area of interest, BMR and hence we utilise st_intersection() to find retain roads that are within the BMR boundaries given by provincedata32647:\n\nroadsbkk &lt;- st_intersection(selectedroadlines,provincedata32647)\n\nThis reduced the data to 19386 rows of data.\nWe take a quick look at the geometry and note that the plot has cleaned up significantly. We will proceed with this data:\n\nplot(st_geometry(roadsbkk))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then check the geometry of roadsbkk:\n\ngeometry_types &lt;- roadsbkk %&gt;%\n  st_geometry_type() %&gt;%\n  as.character() %&gt;%\n  unique()\n\ngeometry_types\n\nBased on the output from above, the roadsbkk data comprises both linestring and multilinestring geometries. Linestring represents a single line, while MultiLinestring represents a collection of multiple lines. We need to simplify the data structure by converting multilinestring to linestring geometry to facilitate downstream analysis as the use of multilinestring might lead to error.\nWe utilise the st_cast() function to break down multilinestring geometries to linestring geometries:\n\nroadsbkk &lt;- st_cast(roadsbkk,\"LINESTRING\",group_or_split = TRUE)\n\nWe double check the geometry types and note from the output below that the geometry is now just linestring:\n\ngeometry_types &lt;- roadsbkk %&gt;%\n  st_geometry_type() %&gt;%\n  as.character() %&gt;%\n  unique()\n\ngeometry_types\n\n\n\n\nWe save this cleaned data as a rds file:\n\nwrite_rds(roadsbkk,\"data/rds/roadsbkk.rds\")\n\n\nroadsbkk &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/roadsbkk.rds\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe carry some EDA to understand how the occurrences of road accidents could be influenced by different factors.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntmap_mode('plot')\ntm_shape(provincedata32647) + \n  tm_polygons() +           \n  tm_shape(roadacc) + \n  tm_dots(col ='red') +\n  tm_shape(roadsbkk)+\n  tm_lines(col = 'black')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen from the map above, road accidents within the BMR seem to be more concentrated within the provinces on the right side (Bangkok, Pathum Thani and Samut Prakan). Plotting the distribution of road accidents across provinces, we note from the plot below that Bangkok has the highest occurrences of road accidents in the BMR, followed by Samut Prakan, Pathum Thani, Samut Sakhon, Nakhon Pathom and Nonthaburi.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(roadacc, aes(x = fct_reorder(province_en, province_en, .fun = length))) + \n  geom_bar(fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Road Accidents across Provinces\", x = \"Province\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(roadacc, aes(x = fct_reorder(agency, agency, .fun = length))) + \n  geom_bar(fill = \"lightgreen\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Road Accidents by Agency\", x = \"Agency\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs noted from the plot, the Department of Highways is responsible for the most occurrences of road accidents in the BMR, followed by Department of Rural Roads and Expressway Authority of Thailand.\n\n\n\nWe also analyse the road accidents by time, namely by year, by month, by day of week and by time of day.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(roadacc, aes(x = inc_year)) + \n  geom_bar(fill = \"slategrey\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Road Accidents by Year\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Count\") +\n  facet_wrap(~province_en)+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1,size = 8))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe note from above that the number of road accidents has generally been increasing in Bangkok and Samut Prakan from 2019 to 2022.\n\nThis is with the exception of a drop in 2021 in Bangkok - this could potentially be due to the surge of COVID-19 cases in Thailand in 2021 which led to a lockdown which meant that there were less tourists, vehicles and pedestrians on the roads, and lower occurrences of road accidents.\n\nWe note that the number of road accidents in Nonthaburi and Pathum Thani increased from 2019 to 2021 and fell in 2022.\nWe note that the number of road accidents in Samut Sakhon fell from 2019 to 2021 but increased in 2022.\nOf the 6 provinces, we note that only Nakhon Pathom experienced a fall in road accidents from 2019 to 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(roadacc, aes(x = inc_month)) + \n  geom_bar(fill = \"slategrey\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Road Accidents by Month\", x = \"Month\", y = \"Count\")+\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\")) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1,size = 8))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the plot above, most road accidents occur in Jan, Apr, Oct and Dec.\nWe also observe the data by month across the years using cycle plots that would enable us to observe cyclical/seasonal patterns, if present.\n\n\n\nTo plot the distribution of road accidents by months across the years, we create a roadacc_month file that groups the road accidents per month for each year.\n\n\nCode\nroadacc_month &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  group_by(inc_year,inc_month) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n\n\n\n\nCode\nwrite_rds(roadacc_month,\"data/rds/roadacc_month.rds\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nroadacc_month &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/roadacc_month.rds\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhline.data &lt;- roadacc_month %&gt;%\n  group_by(inc_month) %&gt;%\n  summarise(avgvalue = mean(count))\n\nggplot(data = roadacc_month, aes(x = inc_year, y = count)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = inc_month, colour = as.factor(inc_month))) +\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=avgvalue),\n             data=hline.data,\n             linetype=6,\n             colour=\"red\",\n             size=0.5)+\n  facet_wrap(~inc_month,scales = \"free_x\")+\n  labs(title = \"Road accidents by month from 2019 to 2022\",\n                   colour = \"Month\") +\n  xlab(\"Year\")+\n  ylab(\"Number of Road Accidents\")+\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Paired\") + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the plot, we observe the following:\n\nApr, Oct and Dec have the highest average number of road accidents across the years\nOccurrences of road accidents in Jan and Feb seem to generally be decreasing over the years, with the number of road accidents in 2022 for both months falling below the average number of road accidents for the month across 2019 to 2022.\nOccurrences of road accidents in Jul, Aug, Oct to Dec seem to generally be increasing over the years.

However, for the other provinces, the difference is not so obvious and it seems like the occurrences of road accidents are more well spread out across the week. This could be explained by Bangkok being a prime tourist destination and major urban centre, and it could attract a greater crowd from within and outside of Thailand over the weekend, hence leading to greater traffic on the road and higher chances of road accidents occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverallBreakdown by province\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(roadacc, aes(x = inc_time)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \"slategrey\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, 1))+\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Road Accidents by Time of Day\", \n       x = \"Time of Day\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1,size = 8))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the chart, it is observed that road accidents occur more often between 7am to 11pm as compared to 12 midnight to 6am.

The top two timings at which road accidents occur are at 9am and 7pm and this could be explained by it being the peak hour at which the general population i.e. workers, school students get to and get off work and school.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(roadacc, aes(x = inc_time)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \"slategrey\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, 1))+\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Road Accidents by Time of Day\", \n       x = \"Time of Day\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  facet_wrap(~province_en, scales = \"fixed\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1,size = 8))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBangkok, Samut Prakan and Pathum Thani also seem to follow the general observation seen under the overall chart for occurrences of road accidents by time day i.e. road accidents generally occur more during 7am to 11pm and peak timings are during the going to and getting off work/school hours at around 9am and 7pm.

    "text": "According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), road traffic accidents cause the death of approximately 1.19 million people each year and leave between 20 to 50 million people with non-fatal injuries. Vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists, make up more than half of all road traffic deaths.\nRoad traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5 to 29, however two-thirds of road traffic fatalities occur among people of working ages, from 18 to 59 years. Further, nine in 10 fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these countries make up only around 60% of the world’s vehicles.\nBesides human suffering, road traffic injuries also result in a heavy economic burden on victims and their families, through treatment costs for the injured and loss of productivity of those killed or disabled. More broadly, road traffic injuries have a serious impact on national economies, costing countries 3% of their annual gross domestic product.\nAccording to the WHO, Thailand’s roads are the deadliest in Southeast Asia and among the worst in the world - about 20,000 people die in road accidents each year, or about 56 deaths a day.\nBetween 2014 and 2021, Thailand experienced a notable increase in accident frequencies. Specifically, 19% of all accidents in Thailand occurred on the national highways, which make up the primary public thoroughfares connecting various regions, provinces, districts, and significant locations within a comprehensive network. Within the broader context of accidents across the country, there existed a considerable 66% likelihood of encountering accident-prone zones, often termed as ‘black spots’ which are distributed as follows: 66% on straight road segments, 13% at curves, 6% at median points of cross-shaped intersections, 5% at T-shaped intersections and Y-shaped intersections, 3% at cross-shaped intersections, 2% on bridges, and 2% on steep slopes."

    "text": "By and large, road traffic accidents can be attributed by two major factors, namely behavioural and environmental factors.\n\nBehavioural factors in driving are considered to be major causes of traffic accidents either in direct or indirect manner (Lewin, 1982). These factors can be further grouped into driver behavior (driver/driving style) and driver performance (driver/driving skills) (Elander, West, & French, 1993).\nEnvironmental factors, on the other hand, includes but not limited to weather conditions such as poor visibility during heavy rain or fogs as well as road conditions such as sharp bends, slippery slopes, and blind spots.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated the significant potential of Spatial Point Patterns Analysis (SPPA) in exploring and identifying factors influencing road traffic accidents. However, these studies often focus solely on either behavioral or environmental factors, with limited consideration of temporal factors such as season, day of the week, or time of day.\nIn view of this, in this hands-on exercise, we will determine factors that affect road traffic accidents in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) by employing both spatial and spatio-temporal point patterns analysis methods.\nThe specific objectives are as follows:\n\nTo visualize the spatio-temporal dynamics of road traffic accidents in BMR using appropriate statistical graphics and geovisualization methods.\nTo conduct detailed spatial analysis of road traffic accidents using appropriate Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods.\nTo conduct detailed spatio-temporal analysis of road traffic accidents using appropriate Temporal Network Spatial Point Patterns Analysis methods."

As such we can proceed with filtering the data to keep our region of interest which comprises Bangkok and five adjacent provinces of Nakhon Pathom, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, Samut Prakan and Samut Sakhon:\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;% \n  filter(province_en %in% c(\"Bangkok\", \"Nakhon Pathom\", \"Nonthaburi\", \"Pathum Thani\",\"Samut Prakan\",\"Samut Sakhon\"))\n\nThis leaves the data with 13336 rows.\n\n\n\nWe further clean the data by removing rows with missing data:\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  drop_na()\n\n\n\n\nWe also check if there are duplicate entries in the dataset:\n\nroadacc$acc_code[duplicated(roadacc$acc_code) == TRUE]\n\nThere are no duplicate entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\nDuring class, Prof Kam had advised to study the data carefully and shared that it was important to filter out data with incomplete coordinates (missing either longitude or latitude or both) and shared that one way to do it was via the code below:\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(longitude) & longitude != \"\",\n         !is.na(latitude) & latitude != \"\")\n\nAs with the drop_na() code above, this way will also leave just 12986 rows of data as the missing data were found in either the longitude or latitude variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe convert roadacc data frame into a simple feature data frame and also transform the data from geographic coordinate system (EPSG: 4326 WGS84 Geographic Coordinate System) to projected coordinate system:\n\nroadacc &lt;- st_as_sf(roadacc, \n                    coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"),\n                    crs=4326) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs = 32647)\n\nBased on the summary statistics of roadacc above, it is noted that the minimum longitude is 99.85° and maximum longitude is 100.94°. While there are 2 possible projected coordinate systems for Thailand, EPSG 32647 and 32648, the appropriate projected coordinate system to transform the data to would be EPSG 32647 as the minimum and maximum longitude of roadacc falls within EPSG 32467’s area of use (between 96°E and 102°E). A comparison of the area of use for both projected coordinate systems is shown below:\n\n\n\n\nEPSG 32647\nEPSG 32648\n\n\n\n\nArea of use\nBetween 96°E and 102°E, northern hemisphere between equator and 84°N, onshore and offshore.

Singapore. Thailand. Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe incident_datetime and report_datetime variables are in datetime field, we hence utilise these variables and the lubridate() function to generate new variables that represent:\n\nmonth: “inc_month”\nday of week: “inc_dayofweek”\ntime of day: “inc_time”\n\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  mutate(inc_year = year(incident_datetime)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(inc_month = month(incident_datetime,\n                       label = TRUE,\n                       abbr = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(inc_dayofweek = wday(incident_datetime,\n                              week_start = getOption(\"lubridate.week.start\", 1),\n                              label = TRUE,\n                              abbr = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(inc_time = hour(incident_datetime))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\nNote that we can generate month in numbers or in factor format via:\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month_num = month(incident_datetime)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month_fac = month(incident_datetime,\n                       label = TRUE,\n                       abbr = TRUE))\n\n\n\nWe also determine the gap between the incident time and reporting time and create a new variable “timegap” in hours unit:\n\nroadacc$timegap &lt;- time_length(roadacc$report_datetime - roadacc$incident_datetime, \"hours\")\n\nLogically, the date and time when the accident was reported should be after the date and time of the accident occurrence. Looking at the summary statistics below, there are data entries that could have been erroneously recorded resulting in a negative time gap between report time and incident time (i.e. report time was earlier than incident time). As such, the data was further filtered to remove erroneous data to avoid affecting the analysis:\n\nsummary(roadacc$timegap)\n\n\nroadacc &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  filter(timegap &gt;= 0)\n\nThis leaves us with 12985 rows.\n\n\n\nWe then save this cleaned data as a rds file:\n\nwrite_rds(roadacc,\"data/rds/roadacc.rds\")\n\n\nroadacc &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/roadacc.rds\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\nIt is good practice to save cleaned file as a new rds file via write_rds() to avoid re-running the data cleaning and wrangling codes. write_rds() will take care of all the objects within the dataset. Once the file is saved, we can add “#| eval: false” to the data cleaning and wrangling codes to avoid re-running them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data has different files providing details of the administrative boundaries of Thailand at different administrative levels:\n\nLevel 0 (country)\nLevel 1 (province)\nLevel 2 (district)\nLevel 3 (sub-district, tambon)\n\nAs our area of interest is at Level 1 (province level), we will utilise “tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121” that reflects details at province levels and import the data using the code chunk below:\n\nprovincedata = st_read(dsn = \"data/rawdata\", \n                  layer = \"tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121\")\n\nWe note from the above that it is a multipolygon feature data frame. We note that there are 77 features and 16 fields, and the data is in WGS84 geographic coordinate system.\nWe then take a glimpse of the data:\n\nglimpse(provincedata)\n\n\n\n\nWe note from a glimpse of the data above that there are only a few pertinent fields that we require for our analysis, specifically:\n\nADM1_EN: province name in english\nShape_Leng\nShape_Area\ngeometry\n\nWe hence filter the data to only comprise these fields to make the data frame more manageable:\n\nprovincedata &lt;- provincedata %&gt;%\n  select(\"ADM1_EN\", \"Shape_Leng\",\"Shape_Area\",\"geometry\")\n\n\n\n\nWe also filter to keep only data that are relevant to our area of interest which is BMR:\n\nprovincedata &lt;- provincedata %&gt;% \n  filter(ADM1_EN %in% c(\"Bangkok\", \"Nakhon Pathom\", \"Nonthaburi\", \"Pathum Thani\",\"Samut Prakan\",\"Samut Sakhon\"))\n\nThis leaves 6 rows of data and 4 variables.\n\n\n\nFrom the code chunk below, it is noted that the EPSG code for the selectedboundaries data frame is EPSG: 4326:\n\nst_crs(provincedata)\n\nWe will need to reproject provincedata from EPSG code to EPSG: 32647 which is the projected coordinate system to use for BMR, our area of interest:\n\nprovincedata32647 &lt;- st_transform(provincedata, \n                              crs = 32647)\n\nWe check if the EPSG code has been correctly assigned:\n\nst_crs(provincedata32647)\n\n\n\n\nWe save this cleaned data as a rds file:\n\nwrite_rds(provincedata32647,\"data/rds/provincedata32647.rds\")\n\n\nprovincedata32647 &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/provincedata32647.rds\")\n\nWe visualise our provincedata32647:\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\ntm_shape(provincedata32647)+\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe import the data as follows:\n\nroadlines = st_read(dsn = \"data/rawdata\",\n                    layer = \"hotosm_tha_roads_lines_shp\")\n\nWe then glimpse at the data:\n\nglimpse(roadlines)\n\n\nst_geometry(roadlines)\n\nThe dataset is of the multilinestring geometry and is very large, with 2792590 rows and 15 variables but we only need to extract relevant information that lie within the BMR for analysis.\n\n\n\nBased on the code chunk below, it is noted that the coordinate system of the roadlines data is missing.\n\nst_crs(roadlines)\n\nBased on the values of the geometry in roadlines, the coordinates seem to be in geographic (latitude/longitude) form, in degrees, typically in a CRS like EPSG:4326 (WGS 84) used for global geographic coordinates. We hence assign the missing EPSG code using the code chunk below:\n\nroadlines4326 &lt;- st_set_crs(roadlines,4326)\n\nWe check the CRS using the code chunk below:\n\nst_crs(roadlines4326)\n\nFor analysis, we would eventually need to overlay the roadlines4326 data with the selectedboundaries32647 data to determine the roads that lie within BMR. In order to perform geoprocessing using two geospatial data, both geospatial data would need to be projected using similar coordinate systems - in this case, it its EPSG: 32647:\n\nroadlines32647 &lt;- st_transform(roadlines4326, crs = 32647)\n\nWe check the CRS code again:\n\nst_crs(roadlines32647)\n\n\n\n\nBased on the columns in the data frame roadlines32647, the columns that seem relevant/useful to retain for analysis are “highway”, “surface”, “smoothness”, “width”, “lanes”, “oneway”, “bridge” and “geometry”.\nHowever before going ahead to retain these variables, we determine the presence of missing data within roadlines32647:\n\nmissing_counts &lt;- sapply(roadlines32647, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))\nprint(missing_counts)\n\nBased on the result we obtained, more than 60% of data is missing for the variable “source” and more than 80% of data is missing for the variables “name”, “name_en”, “surface”, “smoothness”, “width”, “lanes”, “oneway”, “bridge”, “layer”, “source” and “name_th”. Given the extent of missing data, we will omit these columns as they would not provide useful information for analysis and only retain the relevant/useful columns “highway” and “geometry” with no missing data:\n\nselectedroadlines &lt;- roadlines32647 %&gt;%\n  select(\"highway\", \"geometry\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below is used to determine the types of highways in the selectedroadlines data frame:\n\nunique_highway &lt;- unique(selectedroadlines$highway)\nunique_highway &lt;- sort(unique_highway)\n\nunique_highway\n\nWhile there are several classes of highway, our analysis will focus on the major classes of highway as stated on Thailand Highway Classification, otherwise the map will be too overcrowded for analysis and we might also experience lags in rendering the Quarto document.\nA detailed explanation on the selected major highways is indicated in the table below:\n\n\n\nTypes of highway\nDetails\nIncluded for analysis?\n\n\n\n\nmotorway\nExpressway with full access control (source)\nYes\n\n\nprimary\nTop-level urban road across the city connecting trunk to trunk, or road of equal or greater importance than the primary intercity highway that runs through that city (source)\nYes\n\n\nsecondary\nMain urban road connecting primary to primary or higher, or road of equal or greater importance than the secondary intercity highway that runs through that city. Based on table above, motorcars, motorcycles and pedestrians all have access (source)\nYes\n\n\ntertiary\nRoads that are more important than regular unclassified or residential roads, or roads that connect several unclassified or residential roads. Based on table above, motorcars, motorcycles and pedestrians all have access (source)\nYes\n\n\ntrunk\nBased on table above, motorcars, motorcycles and pedestrians all have access (source)\nYes\n\n\n\n\nselectedroadlines &lt;- selectedroadlines %&gt;%\n  filter(highway %in% c(\"motorway\",\"primary\",\"secondary\",\"tertiary\",\"trunk\"))\n\n\n\n\nWe require only a subset of the selectedroadlines data to just roads within our area of interest, BMR and hence we utilise st_intersection() to find retain roads that are within the BMR boundaries given by provincedata32647:\n\nroadsbkk &lt;- st_intersection(selectedroadlines,provincedata32647)\n\nThis reduced the data to 19386 rows of data.\nWe take a quick look at the geometry and note that the plot has cleaned up significantly. We will proceed with this data:\n\nplot(st_geometry(roadsbkk))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then check the geometry of roadsbkk:\n\ngeometry_types &lt;- roadsbkk %&gt;%\n  st_geometry_type() %&gt;%\n  as.character() %&gt;%\n  unique()\n\ngeometry_types\n\nBased on the output from above, the roadsbkk data comprises both linestring and multilinestring geometries. Linestring represents a single line, while MultiLinestring represents a collection of multiple lines. We need to simplify the data structure by converting multilinestring to linestring geometry to facilitate downstream analysis as the use of multilinestring might lead to error.\nWe utilise the st_cast() function to break down multilinestring geometries to linestring geometries:\n\nroadsbkk &lt;- st_cast(roadsbkk,\"LINESTRING\",group_or_split = TRUE)\n\nWe double check the geometry types and note from the output below that the geometry is now just linestring:\n\ngeometry_types &lt;- roadsbkk %&gt;%\n  st_geometry_type() %&gt;%\n  as.character() %&gt;%\n  unique()\n\ngeometry_types\n\n\n\n\nWe save this cleaned data as a rds file:\n\nwrite_rds(roadsbkk,\"data/rds/roadsbkk.rds\")\n\n\nroadsbkk &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/roadsbkk.rds\")"

However, for the other provinces, the difference is not so obvious and it seems like the occurrences of road accidents are more well spread out across the week. This could be explained by Bangkok being a prime tourist destination and major urban centre, and it could attract a greater crowd from within and outside of Thailand over the weekend, hence leading to greater traffic on the road and higher chances of road accidents occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverallBreakdown by province\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(roadacc, aes(x = inc_time)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \"slategrey\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, 1))+\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Road Accidents by Time of Day\", \n       x = \"Time of Day\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1,size = 8))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the chart, it is observed that road accidents occur more often between 7am to 11pm as compared to 12 midnight to 6am.

The top two timings at which road accidents occur are at 9am and 7pm and this could be explained by it being the peak hour at which the general population i.e. workers, school students get to and get off work and school.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(roadacc, aes(x = inc_time)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \"slategrey\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, 1))+\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Road Accidents by Time of Day\", \n       x = \"Time of Day\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  facet_wrap(~province_en, scales = \"fixed\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1,size = 8))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBangkok, Samut Prakan and Pathum Thani also seem to follow the general observation seen under the overall chart for occurrences of road accidents by time day i.e. road accidents generally occur more during 7am to 11pm and peak timings are during the going to and getting off work/school hours at around 9am and 7pm.

We check for duplication in a ppp object via the code chunk below:\n\nany(duplicated(roadacc_ppp))\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nThe data does not have any duplicated points.\n\n\n\nWhen analysing spatial point patterns, it is a good practice to confine the analysis within a geographical area like Singapore boundary. In spatstat, an object called owin is specially designed to represent this polygonal region. The code chunk below is used to covert provincedata32647 SpatialPolygon object into owin object of spatstat:\n\nprovinceowin &lt;- as.owin(provincedata32647)\n\nThe ouput object can be displayed by using plot() function\n\nplot(provinceowin)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary(provinceowin)\n\nWindow: polygonal boundary\nsingle connected closed polygon with 13779 vertices\nenclosing rectangle: [587893.5, 712440.5] x [1484413.7, 1579076.3] units\n                     (124500 x 94660 units)\nWindow area = 7668990000 square units\nFraction of frame area: 0.65\n\n\n\n\n\nWe extract road accident events that are located within the BMR by using the code chunk below:\n\nroadacc_owin_ppp = roadacc_ppp[provinceowin]\n\n\nplot(roadacc_owin_ppp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary(roadacc_owin_ppp)\n\nMarked planar point pattern:  12985 points\nAverage intensity 1.693182e-06 points per square unit\n\nCoordinates are given to 10 decimal places\n\nmarks are numeric, of type 'double'\nSummary:\n   Min. 1st Qu.

However, before we do so, we convert the unit of measurement to kilometer as the default unit of measurement of EPSG: 32647 is in metres, which would make the values hard to comprehend:\n\nroadacc_owin_ppp.km &lt;- rescale.ppp(roadacc_owin_ppp,1000,\"km\")\n\n\n\n\nWe will derive KDE using bw.diggle() of spatstat as it is an automatic bandwidth selection method and does not require a fixed bandwidth to be defined.\n\nkde_roadacc_bw &lt;- density(roadacc_owin_ppp.km,\n                          sigma = bw.diggle,\n                          edge = TRUE,\n                          kernel = \"gaussian\")\n\n\nplot(kde_roadacc_bw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can retrieve the bandwidth used to compute the KDE layer with the code chunk below:\n\nbw &lt;- bw.diggle(roadacc_owin_ppp)\nbw\n\n   sigma \n13.41598 \n\n\n\n\n\nWe convert the KDE output for mapping purposes:\n\ngridded_kde_roadacc_bw &lt;- as.SpatialGridDataFrame.im(kde_roadacc_bw)\nspplot(gridded_kde_roadacc_bw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will convert the gridded KDE object into a RasterLayer object using raster() of raster package:\n\nkde_roadacc_bw_raster &lt;- raster(kde_roadacc_bw)\n\nWe view the properties of kde_roadacc_bw_raster RasterLayer:\n\nkde_roadacc_bw_raster\n\nclass      : RasterLayer \ndimensions : 128, 128, 16384  (nrow, ncol, ncell)\nresolution : 0.973023, 0.7395512  (x, y)\nextent     : 587.8935, 712.4405, 1484.414, 1579.076  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs        : NA \nsource     : memory\nnames      : layer \nvalues     : -4.811931e-14, 233.4629  (min, max)\n\n\nNote that the CRS property is NA.\n\n\n\nWe hence assign CRS information to the kde_roadacc_bw_raster RasterLayer:\n\nprojection(kde_roadacc_bw_raster) &lt;- CRS(\"+init=EPSG:32647\")\n\nkde_roadacc_bw_raster\n\nclass      : RasterLayer \ndimensions : 128, 128, 16384  (nrow, ncol, ncell)\nresolution : 0.973023, 0.7395512  (x, y)\nextent     : 587.8935, 712.4405, 1484.414, 1579.076  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs        : +proj=utm +zone=47 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs \nsource     : memory\nnames      : layer \nvalues     : -4.811931e-14, 233.4629  (min, max)\n\n\nThe CRS property is now completed.\n\n\n\nWe will display the raster in cartographic quality map using tmap package:\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\ntm_shape(kde_roadacc_bw_raster)+   \n  tm_raster(\"layer\",palette = \"viridis\")+   \n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,             \n            legend.outside.position = \"right\",             \n            legend.position = c(\"right\",\"bottom\"),             \n            main.title = \"Distribution of road accidents (bw.diggle)\", \n            main.title.size = 0.8,             \n            frame = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot above, we note that road accidents occur more intensely along the road lines in Bangkok and Samut Prakan. To better understand how the intensity of road accidents occur across the BMR, we will extract the six provinces as different study areas for analysis and comparison in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk will be used to extract the different provinces as different study areas:\n\nbkk &lt;- provincedata32647 %&gt;%\n  filter(ADM1_EN == \"Bangkok\")\nnp &lt;-

of measurement from metres to kilometres as EPSG: 32647 is in metres which would produce density values that are too small to comprehend.\n\nroadacc_bkk_ppp.km =

Most of the road accidents optically seem to occur at 3 segments.\nBangkok - up to 500 to 600. Most of the road accidents optically seem to occur at major road lines.\nSamut Sakhon: Max density up to 300 to 350. Most of the road accidents seem to occur along the same major road.\nPathum Thani - up to 200 to 250. Most of the road accidents seem to occur along the same major road.\nNonthaburi - up to 150 to 200. Most of the road accidents optically seem to be scattered.\nNakhon Pathom - up to 50 to 60. Most of the road accidents optically seem to be scattered.\n\nFurther comments are as follows:\n\nNotably, while Bangkok is a known tourist destination/major urban hub, it ranks second to Samut Prakan in terms of road accident density.\nRoad accidents seem more scattered in Nonthaburi and Nakhon Pathom which suggest that there could be more complex road systems in these areas where accidents could occur at various points.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter running KDE which shows the density of road accidents over the BMR, we will perform the Clark-Evans test of aggregation to statistically validate the degree of spatial clustering or dispersion of the road accident points by comparing the observed mean nearest neighbor distance with the expected average distance between neighbours in a hypothetical random distribution.\nThe test hypotheses are:\nH0: The distribution of road accidents is randomly distributed.\nH1: The distribution of road accidents is not randomly distributed.\nThe 95% confidence interval will be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclarkevans.test(roadacc_owin_ppp.km,\n                correction = \"none\",\n                clipregion = \"province_owin\",\n                alternative = c(\"clustered\"),\n                nsim = 999)\n\n\n    Clark-Evans test\n    No edge correction\n    Z-test\n\ndata:  roadacc_owin_ppp.km\nR = 0.19092, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: clustered (R &lt; 1)\n\n\n\nSince p-value is less than 0.05, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis H0 that the distribution of road accidents is randomly distributed.\nThis is further supported by the R value of 0.19092.

There is sufficient evidence to indicate that the distribution of road accidents in all provinces is not randomly distributed and instead exhibit clustering.\n\n\n\n\nNetwork constrained SPPA (NetSPPA) is a collection of SAPPA methods specially developed for analysing spatial point events that occur on or alongside a network. In this case, it can be used for the analysis of road accidents that occur on or alongside the road lines network in the BMR.\nBefore we go into the analysis, we visualise the geospatial data (to save bandwidth, we directly use plot mode):\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\ntm_shape(roadacc)+\n  tm_dots(col = \"red\")+\n  tm_shape(roadsbkk)+\n  tm_lines()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNKDE is used to visualise and explore the intensity of point processes i.e. road accidents along the network i.e. road lines.\n\n\n\nBefore we compute NKDE, we need to select an appropriate bandwidth. In this case we will use the K nearest neighbour adaptive bandwidth (reference). Under this method, the K nearest neighbour distance could be used as a locally adapted bandwidth for intensity estimation.\nWe will first use the nearest neighbour distance to understand the distance between road accident points along the road lines in BMR - we do this by running nndist() function on our ppp object:\n\nnnd_dist &lt;- nndist(roadacc_owin_ppp.km)\nsummary(nnd_dist)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n0.00000 0.00123 0.01303 0.07336 0.04663 7.73467 \n\n\nThe median and max distance between road lines in BMR is 0.01303 km and 7.73467 km respectively.\nWe first aggregate events that are very close i.e. round up of median distance ~15 metres away:\n\nroadacc$weight &lt;- 1\nroadacc_agg &lt;- aggregate_points(roadacc,15, weight = \"weight\")\n\nWe then calculate for each event its distance to its 20th neighbour:\n\nknn_dists &lt;- network_knn(origins = roadacc_agg,\n                         lines = roadsbkk,\n                         k = 30,\n                         maxdistance = 5000,\n                         line_weight = \"length\",\n                         digits = 2,\n                         tol = 0.1)\n\n\nbws &lt;- knn_dists$distances[,20]\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_histogram(aes(x=bws),\n                 fill = \"white\",\n                 color = \"black\",\n                 bins = 50)+\n  labs(x = \"distance to 20th neighbour (metres)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the histogram above, we note that there are some events for which the 20th neighbour is very far. We decide to trim the bandwidth at 10000 metres.\n\ntrimmed_bw &lt;- ifelse(bws &gt; 10000,10000, bws)\n\n\n\n\nBefore computing NKDE, the roadsbkk object needs to be cut into lixels with a specified minimal distance. We do this using lixelize_lines() of spNetwork.\nTo determine the appropriate lixel size to use, we need to consider several factors such as the scale of our study, density of accidents. road network characteristics. Some reasons are provided below:\n\nscale of study: shorter lixels may allow capturing of finer details for study of road accidents at a local scale however longer lixels may be more suitable to study patterns over larger distances.\ndensity of accidents: high road accident density areas may benefit from shorter lixels that would enable the capture of precise clustering on small road segments. however, long lixels can help to smooth out analysis for less dense areas and avoid overrepresenting sparsely populated segments\nroad network characteristics: more complex road networks may benefit from shorter lixels to indicate the finer details of the road lines while larger road networks may work better with longer lixels.\n\nBased on the analysis of K-nearest neighbors with adaptive bandwidth under 9.1.1 Determining appropriate bandwidth, we observe from the histogram that most road accidents occur within 1000m to 2000m of each other. We hence set the lixel lengths within this distance to help capture the density of accidents more effectively:\n\nlixels &lt;- lixelize_lines(roadsbkk,\n                         2000,\n                         mindist = 1000)\nsamples &lt;- lines_center(lixels)\n\n\ndensities &lt;- nkde(lines = roadsbkk,\n                  events = roadacc_agg,\n                  w = roadacc_agg$weight,\n                  samples = samples,\n                  kernel_name = \"quartic\",\n                  bw = trimmed_bw,\n                  div = \"bw\",\n                  adaptive = FALSE,\n                  method = \"simple\",\n                  digits = 1,\n                  tol = 1,\n                  grid_shape = c(5,5),\n                  verbose = FALSE,\n                  diggle_correction = FALSE,\n                  study_area = NULL,\n                  max_depth = 5,\n                  agg = NULL,\n                  sparse = TRUE)\n\nTo minimise re-running the code above, we save densities generated as a new rds file:\n\n\nCode\nwrite_rds(densities,\"data/rds/densities.rds\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndensities &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/densities.rds\")\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore visualising NKDE values, we insert the computed density values into samples and lixels objects as density field. We also multiply the densities by 1000 to rescale the density values from metres (as the EPSG 32647 projection system is in metres which make the computed density values very small and hard to comprehend) to number of events per kilometer. We then map the result:\n\n# rescaling to help the mapping\nsamples$density &lt;- densities*1000\nlixels$density &lt;- densities*1000\n\n\ncolorRamp &lt;- brewer.pal(n = 5, name = \"Spectral\")\ncolorRamp &lt;- rev(colorRamp)\n\nsamples2 &lt;- samples[order(samples$density),]\ntitle &lt;- paste0(\"Road accident density by kilometres in BMR,\",\n                \"\\nusing an adaptive bandwidth (20th nearest neighbour)\")\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\ntm_shape(roadsbkk) + \n  tm_lines(\"black\") + \n  tm_shape(samples2) + \n  tm_dots(\"density\", style = \"kmeans\", palette = colorRamp, n = 5, size = 0.1) + \n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE, \n            main.title = title, main.title.size = 1)\n\n\nPlotting it in the lixel density format:\n\ncolorRamp &lt;- brewer.pal(n = 5, name = \"RdYlGn\")\ncolorRamp &lt;- rev(colorRamp)\n\nlix_density_break &lt;- quantile(lixels$density, probs = seq(0, 1, length.out = 5))\ntitle &lt;- paste0(\"Road accident density by kilometres in BMR,\",\n                \"\\nusing an adaptive bandwidth (20th nearest neighbour)\")\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\ntm_shape(lixels) +\n  tm_lines(col = \"density\", palette = colorRamp, breaks = lix_density_break) +\n  tm_shape(roadacc_agg) +\n  tm_dots(col = \"black\", size = 0.01)+\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE, \n            main.title = title, main.title.size = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the plot above, we observe the following:\n\nDense occurrence of road accidents within central Bangkok along intricate road networks where there are more complicated road lines\nDenser occurrence of road accidents at intersections of road segments\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents recorded on a network often have a temporal dimension. This is also applicable for road accidents in BMR which have incident datetime data. This will allow us to understand the distribution of road accidents across time and identify if there are certain time periods where road accidents might occur more often.\nWe will explore the density of road accidents in time, specifically by month, by day of week and by time of day.

This means that each road accident will be equally weight in the KDE calculation.\nWe also generate a sample range starting from the minimum to maximum month in inc_month column of the roadacc dataset, with increments of 0.5. As a recap, inc_month represents the month of the occurrence of the incident.\n\nw &lt;- rep(1,nrow(roadacc))\nsamples &lt;- seq(min(roadacc$inc_month),max(roadacc$inc_month),0.5)\n\nThe kernel density estimation is calculated for several bandwidths (bw 1 to bw 6 as seen in the codes below). Each bandwidth gives a different smoothing effect on the density estimate. bw 1 gives a more sensitive estimate, capturing fine details in the distribution of road accidents while larger bandwidth bw 6 will create a smoother density estimate by averaging over a wider range of data points.\n\nmonth_kernel_val &lt;- data.frame(\n  bw_1 = tkde(roadacc$inc_month, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 1, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_2 = tkde(roadacc$inc_month, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 2, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_3 = tkde(roadacc$inc_month, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 3, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_4 = tkde(roadacc$inc_month, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 4, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_5 = tkde(roadacc$inc_month, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 5, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_6 = tkde(roadacc$inc_month, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 6, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  month = samples\n)\n\n\ndf_month &lt;- reshape2::melt(month_kernel_val, id.vars = \"month\")\n\ndf_month$variable &lt;- as.factor(df_month$variable)\n\nggplot(data = df_month)+\n  geom_line(aes(x=month,y=value))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks =1:12, labels = c(\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\")) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(variable),ncol=2, scales=\"free\")+\n  labs(title = \"Temporal KDE for Occurrence of Road Accidents by Month\", x = \"Month\", y=\"Density\")+\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the plots above, we observe that:\n\nthe density curve for bw 1 is more jagged, reflecting more clearly the variations between the months - there are more significant drops in densities of road accidents in Feb, May and Nov while there are significant increases in densities of road accidents slightly before Apr, Oct and Dec.\nthe density curve starts to smooth out from bw 2. bw 3 and bw 4 seem to best capture the bimodal shape of the temporal dimension of road accidents before the bimodal shape starts to be less obvious in bw 5 and is entirely gone in bw 6 (this is hence why we stop at bw 6 and do not explore further bandwidths).\nfor bw 3 and 4, it is clear that occurrence of road accidents is most dense at the start (~Mar to Apr) and end of the year (towards the Oct period), while the occurrence of road accidents is less dense in the middle part of the year. This could be explained by the holiday seasons near the start and end of year that could have led to higher traffic on the roads. Further, the peak near Apr could be explained by the Songkran (Thai New Year) Festival that occurs annually in Apr, which could have led to more traffic and pedestrians on the road, increasing the chances of accidents.\n\n\n\n\nWe conduct a similar analysis to study the distribution of road accidents by day of week. It is important to recall that we assigned the week to start from Monday during the data wrangling steps in Part 1A.\n\nw &lt;- rep(1,nrow(roadacc))\nsamples &lt;- seq(min(roadacc$inc_dayofweek),max(roadacc$inc_dayofweek),0.5)\n\nday_kernel_val &lt;- data.frame(\n  bw_1 = tkde(roadacc$inc_dayofweek, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 1, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_2 = tkde(roadacc$inc_dayofweek, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 2, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_3 = tkde(roadacc$inc_dayofweek, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 3, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_4 = tkde(roadacc$inc_dayofweek, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 4, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  day = samples\n)\n\n\ndf_day &lt;- reshape2::melt(day_kernel_val, id.vars = \"day\")\ndf_day$variable &lt;- as.factor(df_day$variable)\n\nggplot(data = df_day)+\n  geom_line(aes(x=day,y=value))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks =1:7, labels = c(\"Mon\",\"Tues\",\"Wed\",\"Thu\",\"Fri\",\"Sat\",\"Sun\")) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(variable),ncol=2, scales=\"free\")+\n  labs(title = \"Temporal KDE for Occurrence of Road Accidents by Day of the Week\", x = \"Day\", y=\"Density\")+\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the plots above, we observe that:\n\nthe density curve for bw 1 is more jagged, reflecting more clearly the variations between the days - there are more significant increases in densities of road accidents from Fri to Sat. This could be explained by Fri and Sat being the start of the weekend and more traffic and pedestrians being out on the road for social activities.\nthe density curve starts to smooth out in bw 2 and seem to best capture the bimodal shape of the temporal dimension of road accidents - the density of road accidents increase between Fri to Sat and then drop on Sun and Mon before increasing on Tues again. As stated in the above point, the increase between Fri and Sat can be explained by these days being the start of the weekend, the drop in Sun and Mon could be due to less traffic as people start to get ready for the work/school week ahead and potentially even Mon blues when less people might travel to work. The increase in road accidents from Tues could be due to the steady stream of office workers/school children heading to office/school.\nThe bimodal shape becomes less obvious/almost entirely gone in bw3 and 4 (this is hence why we stop at bw 4 and do not explore further bandwidths).\n\n\n\n\nWe conduct a similar analysis to study the distribution of road accidents by time of day.\n\nw &lt;- rep(1,nrow(roadacc))\nsamples &lt;- seq(min(roadacc$inc_time),max(roadacc$inc_time),0.5)\n\ntime_kernel_val &lt;- data.frame(\n  bw_1 = tkde(roadacc$inc_time, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 1, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_2 = tkde(roadacc$inc_time, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 2, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_3 = tkde(roadacc$inc_time, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 3, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_4 = tkde(roadacc$inc_time, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 4, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_5 = tkde(roadacc$inc_time, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 5, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_6 = tkde(roadacc$inc_time, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 6, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  time = samples\n)\n\n\ndf_time &lt;- reshape2::melt(time_kernel_val, id.vars = \"time\")\ndf_time$variable &lt;- as.factor(df_time$variable)\n\nggplot(data = df_time)+\n  geom_line(aes(x=time,y=value))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks =1:24) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(variable),ncol=2, scales=\"free\")+\n  labs(title = \"Temporal KDE for Occurrence of Road Accidents by Time of Day\", x = \"Time\", y=\"Density\")+\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the plots above, we observe that:\n\nthe density curve for bw 1 is more jagged, reflecting more clearly the variations between the hours of the day - there are more significant increases in densities of road accidents from 7am. This could be explained by 7am being the start of the day and more traffic and pedestrians being out on the road for their daily activities.\nthe density curve starts to smooth out from bw 2 showing the period of 7am to 11am as the peak of the density of road accidents, how it dips from 12pm to 1pm (which could be explained by it being lunch hour and regular workers might be having their lunch rather than being out on the road) and the slight increase between 6pm to 8pm which is the knock-off time for office workers, hence leading to more traffic and pedestrians on the road. the density of road accidents dip significantly from 11pm which could be explained by it being the end of the day for most people hence leading to less traffic on the road and lower chances of road accidents occurring.\nthe density curve starts to smooth out significantly from bw 3 onwards before forming an entirely smooth hump in bw 6 (this is hence why we stop at bw 6 and do not explore further bandwidths).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now combine the separate spatial and temporal analysis carried out in sections above under one combined spatio-temporal analysis.\n\nWhile spatial analysis helps us to understand the pattern of events i.e. road accidents across geographical locations, it treats time as static and might miss how phenomena evolves over time.\nWhile temporal analysis studies changes over time, it ignores spatial relationships and might overlook how events at different locations might be interconnected.\nSpatio-temporal analysis provides an understanding of how events, in this case road accidents, are change across both space and time.\n\nUnder this section, the specific research questions we would like to answer are:\n\nare the locations of road accidents in BMR spatially and spatio-temporally independent?\nif the answer is no, where and when do the observed road accidents tend to cluster?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a recap, we visualise the distribution of road accidents by month:\n\ntm_shape(provincedata32647)+\n  tm_polygons()+\n  tm_shape(roadacc)+\n  tm_dots(size=0.05,col = \"blue\",alpha =0.5)+\n  tm_facets(by=\"inc_month\",\n            free.coords = FALSE,\n            drop.units = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, there seem to be more road accidents in Apr, Oct and Dec.\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will compute STKDE using spattemp.density() of sparr package.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below removes the unwanted fields from roadacc dataframe as as.ppp() only requires the month and geometry field from the input roadacc sf dataframe.\n\nroadacc_month &lt;- roadacc %&gt;%\n  select(inc_month)\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below is used to derive a ppp object frm the roadacc_month sf dataframe:\n\nroadacc_month_ppp &lt;- as.ppp(roadacc_month)\nroadacc_month_ppp\n\nMarked planar point pattern: 12985 points\nmarks are numeric, of storage type  'double'\nwindow: rectangle = [591277.5, 710166.1] x [1486845.7, 1576520.5] units\n\n\nThe code chunk below is used to check that the output is in the correct object class:\n\nsummary(roadacc_month_ppp)\n\nMarked planar point pattern:  12985 points\nAverage intensity 1.217956e-06 points per square unit\n\n*Pattern contains duplicated points*\n\nCoordinates are given to 10 decimal places\n\nmarks are numeric, of type 'double'\nSummary:\n   Min. 1st Qu.

(especially towards Mar to Apr) and end of the year (towards the Oct period), while the occurrence of road accidents is less dense in the middle part of the year.\n\n\nDense occurrence of road accidents in the later half of the year i.e Oct to Dec, as compared to the earlier half of the year.\n\nWhile there are differences in temporal KDE and Spatio-Temporal KDE plots, together they indicate the following:\n\nRoad accidents tend to occur more intensely at the end of the year, with lower occurrences in the middle segment of the year.\nThere could be a high overall accident count in Mar to Apr but the spatial distribution during this period might be more dispersed, leading to less prominent hotspots in the KDE maps.\nOct to Dec seem to have high overall accident counts that are concentrated leading to very prominent hotspots in the KDE map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe run similar steps in section 11.1 above to study the distribution of road accidents by day of

observations\n\n\n\n\n\nOccurrence of road accidents is most dense on Fri and Sat\n\n\nDense occurrence of road accidents from Fri to Mon, however road accidents on Sun and Mon seem to be more spatially concentrated than Fri and Sat\n\nWhile there are differences in temporal KDE and Spatio-Temporal KDE plots, together they indicate the following:\n\nRoad accidents occur in high accident counts at the start of the weekend\nThe spatial distribution of road accidents on Sun and Mon are more concentrated as compared to Fri and Sat, leading to more prominent hotspots in the KDE map.\n\nThis could potentially be explained by Fri and Sat being the start of the weekend vs Sun and Mon which are closer to the start of the week and while people may venture out to different places to carry out their social activities on Fri and Sat, they may travel to a smaller subset of locations i.e. home on Sun to rest before the start of the week or to work/school on Mon for the start of the week, hence leading to more concentrated occurrences of road accidents on Sun and Mon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe run similar steps as above to study the distribution of road accidents by time of

Wide curve and grade-separated intersection/ramps are also top road descriptions for road accidents.\n\n\nRoad accidents across BMR are not randomly distributed and exhibit clustering\nRoad accidents occur more intensely along the road lines in Bangkok and Samut Prakan\n\nDense occurrence of road accidents within central Bangkok along intricate road networks\n\nOverall, observe denser occurrence of road accidents at intersections of road segments\n\n-\n\nPrioritise road accident prevention efforts on Bangkok and Samut Prakan, followed by Pathum Thani, Samut Sakhon, Nakhon Pathom and finally Nonthaburi\nWithin the provinces, to conduct in-depth study on conditions of straight roads and roads with no slopes, especially at points where such roads meet at intersections. This can be followed by studies on roads with wide curve and grade-separated intersection/ramps.\nPreventive measures can be:\n\nPublic education campaigns that highlight the risks of road accidents even on seemingly safe straight roads, to increase driver’s and pedestrians’ awareness of risks and not to be complacent.\nClearer signs can be placed along straight roads to remind drivers and pedestrians of safe road practices.\nPlace more cameras along these roads to capture errant/risky behaviour and to send warning/enforcement letters to prevent the same driver/pedestrian from making similar/more severe mistakes in future\n\n\n\n\n2\nTime\n\nRoad accidents tend to occur more often near the start and end of the year\n\nIncreasing trend of road accidents in the later months i.e. Oct to Dec, over the years\n\nRoad accidents seem to occur more on Fri and Sat\nRoad accidents seem to occur more often between 7am to 11pm, with the top two timings at 9am and 7pm\n\n-\n\nRoad accidents tend to occur more intensely at the end of the year, with lower occurrences in the middle segment of the year.\n\nThere could be a high overall accident count at the start of the year but the spatial distribution during this period might be more dispersed\nRoad accidents near the end of the year seem to be more concentrated\n\nRoad accidents occur in high accident counts at the start of the weekend\n\nThe spatial distribution of road accidents on Sun and Mon are more concentrated as compared to Fri and Sat\n\nOccurrence of road accidents is more intense during the hours from 7am to 11pm\n\n\nTo focus on preventive efforts in the later months of the year i.e. ramp up public education campaigns, to patrol the roads more often or to set up more traffic control points as compared to the early months of the year\nTo step up road control measures from Fri to Mon\n\nFor Fri and Sat, the spatial distribution of road accidents are more dispersed hence might require more manpower to form a larger patrol group or more traffic check points to monitor traffic and prevent accidents\nFor Sun and Mon, the spatial distribution of road accidents is more concentrated. A study can be carried out to shortlist the hotspots and patrol or traffice control efforts can be more focused on these areas on these two days\n\nAs the peak hours are at 9am and 7pm, Thai government can considering introducing policies to encourage the population to head to work or school at earlier or later timings to stagger traffic and reduce the risks of accidents. For instance, offering discount toll rates or public transport fees at earlier or later offpeak timings to entice population to utilise the transport modes at different timings.\n\n\n\n3\nWeather conditions\n\nRoad accidents most frequently occur during clear weather conditions followed by rainy and dark conditions\n\n-\n-\n\nTo focus on needle-moving strategies that can prevent road accidents during clear weather conditions i.e. to install more warning signs and speed cameras along the locations stated in S/N 1 for deterrence.\n\n\n\n4\nHuman factors\n\nRoad accidents mostly involve private/passenger car, followed by 4-wheel pickup truck and motorcycle as top 3 vehicles\nTop presumed cause is speeding\nTop accident types are rear-end collision and rollover/fallen on straight road\n\n-\n-\n\nTo focus public education efforts on drivers with private/passenger car, 4-wheel pickup truck and motorcycle licenses i.e. mailers to these group of drivers. As a pre-emptive measure, to place greater emphasis on safety practices and road guidelines when prospective drivers apply for the licenses for these vehicles.\nTo set up more speed cameras along locations in S/N 1 to identify errant drivers and as a form of deterrence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Thailand#Highway_classification\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spNetwork/vignettes/NKDE.html\nhttps://jeremygelb.github.io/spNetwork/articles/web_vignettes/AdaptiveBW.html\nhttps://jeremygelb.github.io/spNetwork/articles/NKDE.html\nhttps://jeremygelb.github.io/spNetwork/articles/TNKDE.html"

    "text": "We will conduct a Spatial Point Pattern Analysis (SPPA) to evaluate the distribution of road accidents within the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR).\nThe specific questions we would like to answer are as follows:\n\nare the road accidents in BMR randomly distributed throughout the region?\nif no, then where are the locations with higher concentration of road accidents?\n\nSpecifically, we will be carrying out the following SPPA methods:\n\nFirst-order SPPA\nSpatial analysis of road traffic accidents using Network SPPA methods.\nSpatio-temporal analysis of road accidents using Temporal Network SPPA methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we carry out spatial point pattern analysis, we need to convert the data from sf format to ppp format:\n\nroadacc_ppp &lt;- as.ppp(roadacc)\nroadacc_ppp\n\nMarked planar point pattern: 12985 points\nmarks are numeric, of storage type  'double'\nwindow: rectangle = [591277.5, 710166.1] x [1486845.7, 1576520.5] units\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots roadacc_ppp for visualisation:\n\nplot(roadacc_ppp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe take a quick look at the summary statistics of the roadacc_ppp object using the code chunk below:\n\nsummary(roadacc_ppp)\n\nMarked planar point pattern:  12985 points\nAverage intensity 1.217956e-06 points per square unit\n\nCoordinates are given to 10 decimal places\n\nmarks are numeric, of type 'double'\nSummary:\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.

We check for duplication in a ppp object via the code chunk below:\n\nany(duplicated(roadacc_ppp))\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nThe data does not have any duplicated points.\n\n\n\nWhen analysing spatial point patterns, it is a good practice to confine the analysis within a geographical area like Singapore boundary. In spatstat, an object called owin is specially designed to represent this polygonal region. The code chunk below is used to covert provincedata32647 SpatialPolygon object into owin object of spatstat:\n\nprovinceowin &lt;- as.owin(provincedata32647)\n\nThe ouput object can be displayed by using plot() function\n\nplot(provinceowin)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary(provinceowin)\n\nWindow: polygonal boundary\nsingle connected closed polygon with 13779 vertices\nenclosing rectangle: [587893.5, 712440.5] x [1484413.7, 1579076.3] units\n                     (124500 x 94660 units)\nWindow area = 7668990000 square units\nFraction of frame area: 0.65\n\n\n\n\n\nWe extract road accident events that are located within the BMR by using the code chunk below:\n\nroadacc_owin_ppp = roadacc_ppp[provinceowin]\n\n\nplot(roadacc_owin_ppp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary(roadacc_owin_ppp)\n\nMarked planar point pattern:  12985 points\nAverage intensity 1.693182e-06 points per square unit\n\nCoordinates are given to 10 decimal places\n\nmarks are numeric, of type 'double'\nSummary:\n   Min. 1st Qu.

However, before we do so, we convert the unit of measurement to kilometer as the default unit of measurement of EPSG: 32647 is in metres, which would make the values hard to comprehend:\n\nroadacc_owin_ppp.km &lt;- rescale.ppp(roadacc_owin_ppp,1000,\"km\")\n\n\n\n\nWe will derive KDE using bw.diggle() of spatstat as it is an automatic bandwidth selection method and does not require a fixed bandwidth to be defined.\n\nkde_roadacc_bw &lt;- density(roadacc_owin_ppp.km,\n                          sigma = bw.diggle,\n                          edge = TRUE,\n                          kernel = \"gaussian\")\n\n\nplot(kde_roadacc_bw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can retrieve the bandwidth used to compute the KDE layer with the code chunk below:\n\nbw &lt;- bw.diggle(roadacc_owin_ppp)\nbw\n\n   sigma \n13.41598 \n\n\n\n\n\nWe convert the KDE output for mapping purposes:\n\ngridded_kde_roadacc_bw &lt;- as.SpatialGridDataFrame.im(kde_roadacc_bw)\nspplot(gridded_kde_roadacc_bw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will convert the gridded KDE object into a RasterLayer object using raster() of raster package:\n\nkde_roadacc_bw_raster &lt;- raster(kde_roadacc_bw)\n\nWe view the properties of kde_roadacc_bw_raster RasterLayer:\n\nkde_roadacc_bw_raster\n\nclass      : RasterLayer \ndimensions : 128, 128, 16384  (nrow, ncol, ncell)\nresolution : 0.973023, 0.7395512  (x, y)\nextent     : 587.8935, 712.4405, 1484.414, 1579.076  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs        : NA \nsource     : memory\nnames      : layer \nvalues     : -4.811931e-14, 233.4629  (min, max)\n\n\nNote that the CRS property is NA.\n\n\n\nWe hence assign CRS information to the kde_roadacc_bw_raster RasterLayer:\n\nprojection(kde_roadacc_bw_raster) &lt;- CRS(\"+init=EPSG:32647\")\n\nkde_roadacc_bw_raster\n\nclass      : RasterLayer \ndimensions : 128, 128, 16384  (nrow, ncol, ncell)\nresolution : 0.973023, 0.7395512  (x, y)\nextent     : 587.8935, 712.4405, 1484.414, 1579.076  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs        : +proj=utm +zone=47 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs \nsource     : memory\nnames      : layer \nvalues     : -4.811931e-14, 233.4629  (min, max)\n\n\nThe CRS property is now completed.\n\n\n\nWe will display the raster in cartographic quality map using tmap package:\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\ntm_shape(kde_roadacc_bw_raster)+   \n  tm_raster(\"layer\",palette = \"viridis\")+   \n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,             \n            legend.outside.position = \"right\",             \n            legend.position = c(\"right\",\"bottom\"),             \n            main.title = \"Distribution of road accidents (bw.diggle)\", \n            main.title.size = 0.8,             \n            frame = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot above, we note that road accidents occur more intensely along the road lines in Bangkok and Samut Prakan. To better understand how the intensity of road accidents occur across the BMR, we will extract the six provinces as different study areas for analysis and comparison in the next

Most of the road accidents optically seem to occur at major road lines.\nSamut Sakhon: Max density up to 300 to 350. Most of the road accidents seem to occur along the same major road.\nPathum Thani - up to 200 to 250. Most of the road accidents seem to occur along the same major road.\nNonthaburi - up to 150 to 200. Most of the road accidents optically seem to be scattered.\nNakhon Pathom - up to 50 to 60. Most of the road accidents optically seem to be scattered.\n\nFurther comments are as follows:\n\nNotably, while Bangkok is a known tourist destination/major urban hub, it ranks second to Samut Prakan in terms of road accident density.\nRoad accidents seem more scattered in Nonthaburi and Nakhon Pathom which suggest that there could be more complex road systems in these areas where accidents could occur at various points."

    "text": "The first-order SPPA will study how the intensity of road accidents vary across the BMR i.e. identify whether road accidents are more concentrated in areas due to underlying properties of the spatial environment.\nFor first-order SPPA, we will:\n\nderive the kernel density estimation (KDE) layer for visualising and exploring the intensity of point processes,\nperform Confirmatory SPPA using Nearest Neighbour statistics to determine if the road accidents are randomly distributed or influenced by underlying properties of the spatial environment.\n\n\n\nWe will proceed to compute the KDE of road accidents in the BMR. However, before we do so, we convert the unit of measurement to kilometer as the default unit of measurement of EPSG: 32647 is in metres, which would make the values hard to comprehend:\n\nroadacc_owin_ppp.km &lt;- rescale.ppp(roadacc_owin_ppp,1000,\"km\")\n\n\n\n\nWe will derive KDE using bw.diggle() of spatstat as it is an automatic bandwidth selection method and does not require a fixed bandwidth to be defined.\n\nkde_roadacc_bw &lt;- density(roadacc_owin_ppp.km,\n                          sigma = bw.diggle,\n                          edge = TRUE,\n                          kernel = \"gaussian\")\n\n\nplot(kde_roadacc_bw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can retrieve the bandwidth used to compute the KDE layer with the code chunk below:\n\nbw &lt;- bw.diggle(roadacc_owin_ppp)\nbw\n\n   sigma \n13.41598 \n\n\n\n\n\nWe convert the KDE output for mapping purposes:\n\ngridded_kde_roadacc_bw &lt;- as.SpatialGridDataFrame.im(kde_roadacc_bw)\nspplot(gridded_kde_roadacc_bw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will convert the gridded KDE object into a RasterLayer object using raster() of raster package:\n\nkde_roadacc_bw_raster &lt;- raster(kde_roadacc_bw)\n\nWe view the properties of kde_roadacc_bw_raster RasterLayer:\n\nkde_roadacc_bw_raster\n\nclass      : RasterLayer \ndimensions : 128, 128, 16384  (nrow, ncol, ncell)\nresolution : 0.973023, 0.7395512  (x, y)\nextent     : 587.8935, 712.4405, 1484.414, 1579.076  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs        : NA \nsource     : memory\nnames      : layer \nvalues     : -4.811931e-14, 233.4629  (min, max)\n\n\nNote that the CRS property is NA.\n\n\n\nWe hence assign CRS information to the kde_roadacc_bw_raster RasterLayer:\n\nprojection(kde_roadacc_bw_raster) &lt;- CRS(\"+init=EPSG:32647\")\n\nkde_roadacc_bw_raster\n\nclass      : RasterLayer \ndimensions : 128, 128, 16384  (nrow, ncol, ncell)\nresolution : 0.973023, 0.7395512  (x, y)\nextent     : 587.8935, 712.4405, 1484.414, 1579.076  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs        : +proj=utm +zone=47 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs \nsource     : memory\nnames      : layer \nvalues     : -4.811931e-14, 233.4629  (min, max)\n\n\nThe CRS property is now completed.\n\n\n\nWe will display the raster in cartographic quality map using tmap package:\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\ntm_shape(kde_roadacc_bw_raster)+   \n  tm_raster(\"layer\",palette = \"viridis\")+   \n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,             \n            legend.outside.position = \"right\",             \n            legend.position = c(\"right\",\"bottom\"),             \n            main.title = \"Distribution of road accidents (bw.diggle)\", \n            main.title.size = 0.8,             \n            frame = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot above, we note that road accidents occur more intensely along the road lines in Bangkok and Samut Prakan. To better understand how the intensity of road accidents occur across the BMR, we will extract the six provinces as different study areas for analysis and comparison in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk will be used to extract the different provinces as different study areas:\n\nbkk &lt;- provincedata32647 %&gt;%\n  filter(ADM1_EN == \"Bangkok\")\nnp &lt;-

of measurement from metres to kilometres as EPSG: 32647 is in metres which would produce density values that are too small to comprehend.\n\nroadacc_bkk_ppp.km = rescale.ppp(roadacc_bkk_ppp,1000,\"km\")\nroadacc_np_ppp.km = rescale.ppp(roadacc_np_ppp,1000,\"km\")\nroadacc_n_ppp.km = rescale.ppp(roadacc_n_ppp,1000,\"km\")\nroadacc_pt_ppp.km =

minimise re-running the codes

read_rds(\"data/rds/roadacc_sp_ppp.km.rds\")\nroadacc_ss_ppp.km &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/roadacc_ss_ppp.km.rds\")\n\nWe then plot the 6 provinces and the locations of the road accidents:\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,3))\nplot(roadacc_bkk_ppp.km,main=\"Bangkok\")\nplot(roadacc_np_ppp.km,main=\"Nakhon Pathom\")\nplot(roadacc_n_ppp.km,main=\"Nonthaburi\")

                   kernel = \"gaussian\")\n\nWe also save and load these as new rds files to minimise re-running the code

Most of the road accidents optically seem to occur at major road lines.\nSamut Sakhon: Max density up to 300 to 350. Most of the road accidents seem to occur along the same major road.\nPathum Thani - up to 200 to 250. Most of the road accidents seem to occur along the same major road.\nNonthaburi - up to 150 to 200. Most of the road accidents optically seem to be scattered.\nNakhon Pathom - up to 50 to 60. Most of the road accidents optically seem to be scattered.\n\nFurther comments are as follows:\n\nNotably, while Bangkok is a known tourist destination/major urban hub, it ranks second to Samut Prakan in terms of road accident density.\nRoad accidents seem more scattered in Nonthaburi and Nakhon Pathom which suggest that there could be more complex road systems in these areas where accidents could occur at various points."

    "text": "Network constrained SPPA (NetSPPA) is a collection of SAPPA methods specially developed for analysing spatial point events that occur on or alongside a network. In this case, it can be used for the analysis of road accidents that occur on or alongside the road lines network in the BMR.\nBefore we go into the analysis, we visualise the geospatial data (to save bandwidth, we directly use plot mode):\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\ntm_shape(roadacc)+\n  tm_dots(col = \"red\")+\n  tm_shape(roadsbkk)+\n  tm_lines()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNKDE is used to visualise and explore the intensity of point processes i.e. road accidents along the network i.e. road lines.\n\n\n\nBefore we compute NKDE, we need to select an appropriate bandwidth. In this case we will use the K nearest neighbour adaptive bandwidth (reference). Under this method, the K nearest neighbour distance could be used as a locally adapted bandwidth for intensity estimation.\nWe will first use the nearest neighbour distance to understand the distance between road accident points along the road lines in BMR - we do this by running nndist() function on our ppp object:\n\nnnd_dist &lt;- nndist(roadacc_owin_ppp.km)\nsummary(nnd_dist)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Max. \n0.00000 0.00123 0.01303 0.07336 0.04663 7.73467 \n\n\nThe median and max distance between road lines in BMR is 0.01303 km and 7.73467 km respectively.\nWe first aggregate events that are very close i.e. round up of median distance ~15 metres away:\n\nroadacc$weight &lt;- 1\nroadacc_agg &lt;- aggregate_points(roadacc,15, weight = \"weight\")\n\nWe then calculate for each event its distance to its 20th neighbour:\n\nknn_dists &lt;- network_knn(origins = roadacc_agg,\n                         lines = roadsbkk,\n                         k = 30,\n                         maxdistance = 5000,\n                         line_weight = \"length\",\n                         digits = 2,\n                         tol = 0.1)\n\n\nbws &lt;- knn_dists$distances[,20]\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_histogram(aes(x=bws),\n                 fill = \"white\",\n                 color = \"black\",\n                 bins = 50)+\n  labs(x = \"distance to 20th neighbour (metres)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the histogram above, we note that there are some events for which the 20th neighbour is very far. We decide to trim the bandwidth at 10000 metres.\n\ntrimmed_bw &lt;- ifelse(bws &gt; 10000,10000, bws)\n\n\n\n\nBefore computing NKDE, the roadsbkk object needs to be cut into lixels with a specified minimal distance. We do this using lixelize_lines() of spNetwork.\nTo determine the appropriate lixel size to use, we need to consider several factors such as the scale of our study, density of accidents. road network characteristics. Some reasons are provided below:\n\nscale of study: shorter lixels may allow capturing of finer details for study of road accidents at a local scale however longer lixels may be more suitable to study patterns over larger distances.\ndensity of accidents: high road accident density areas may benefit from shorter lixels that would enable the capture of precise clustering on small road segments. however, long lixels can help to smooth out analysis for less dense areas and avoid overrepresenting sparsely populated segments\nroad network characteristics: more complex road networks may benefit from shorter lixels to indicate the finer details of the road lines while larger road networks may work better with longer lixels.\n\nBased on the analysis of K-nearest neighbors with adaptive bandwidth under 9.1.1 Determining appropriate bandwidth, we observe from the histogram that most road accidents occur within 1000m to 2000m of each other. We hence set the lixel lengths within this distance to help capture the density of accidents more effectively:\n\nlixels &lt;- lixelize_lines(roadsbkk,\n                         2000,\n                         mindist = 1000)\nsamples &lt;- lines_center(lixels)\n\n\ndensities &lt;- nkde(lines = roadsbkk,\n                  events = roadacc_agg,\n                  w = roadacc_agg$weight,\n                  samples = samples,\n                  kernel_name = \"quartic\",\n                  bw = trimmed_bw,\n                  div = \"bw\",\n                  adaptive = FALSE,\n                  method = \"simple\",\n                  digits = 1,\n                  tol = 1,\n                  grid_shape = c(5,5),\n                  verbose = FALSE,\n                  diggle_correction = FALSE,\n                  study_area = NULL,\n                  max_depth = 5,\n                  agg = NULL,\n                  sparse = TRUE)\n\nTo minimise re-running the code above, we save densities generated as a new rds file:\n\n\nCode\nwrite_rds(densities,\"data/rds/densities.rds\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndensities &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/densities.rds\")\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore visualising NKDE values, we insert the computed density values into samples and lixels objects as density field. We also multiply the densities by 1000 to rescale the density values from metres (as the EPSG 32647 projection system is in metres which make the computed density values very small and hard to comprehend) to number of events per kilometer. We then map the result:\n\n# rescaling to help the mapping\nsamples$density &lt;- densities*1000\nlixels$density &lt;- densities*1000\n\n\ncolorRamp &lt;- brewer.pal(n = 5, name = \"Spectral\")\ncolorRamp &lt;- rev(colorRamp)\n\nsamples2 &lt;- samples[order(samples$density),]\ntitle &lt;- paste0(\"Road accident density by kilometres in BMR,\",\n                \"\\nusing an adaptive bandwidth (20th nearest neighbour)\")\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\ntm_shape(roadsbkk) + \n  tm_lines(\"black\") + \n  tm_shape(samples2) + \n  tm_dots(\"density\", style = \"kmeans\", palette = colorRamp, n = 5, size = 0.1) + \n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE, \n            main.title = title, main.title.size = 1)\n\n\nPlotting it in the lixel density format:\n\ncolorRamp &lt;- brewer.pal(n = 5, name = \"RdYlGn\")\ncolorRamp &lt;- rev(colorRamp)\n\nlix_density_break &lt;- quantile(lixels$density, probs = seq(0, 1, length.out = 5))\ntitle &lt;- paste0(\"Road accident density by kilometres in BMR,\",\n                \"\\nusing an adaptive bandwidth (20th nearest neighbour)\")\n\ntmap_mode('plot')\ntm_shape(lixels) +\n  tm_lines(col = \"density\", palette = colorRamp, breaks = lix_density_break) +\n  tm_shape(roadacc_agg) +\n  tm_dots(col = \"black\", size = 0.01)+\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE, \n            main.title = title, main.title.size = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the plot above, we observe the following:\n\nDense occurrence of road accidents within central Bangkok along intricate road networks where there are more complicated road lines\nDenser occurrence of road accidents at intersections of road segments"

    "text": "Events recorded on a network often have a temporal dimension. This is also applicable for road accidents in BMR which have incident datetime data. This will allow us to understand the distribution of road accidents across time and identify if there are certain time periods where road accidents might occur more often.\nWe will explore the density of road accidents in time, specifically by month, by day of week and by time of day. EDA exploring these time elements in the data can be found in Part 1A.\n\n\n\nroadacc$inc_month &lt;- as.numeric(roadacc$inc_month)\nroadacc$inc_dayofweek &lt;- as.numeric(roadacc$inc_dayofweek)\nroadacc$inc_time &lt;- as.numeric(roadacc$inc_time)\n\nWe utilise the tkde() function to calculate the temporal kernel density estimate.\nWe initialize the weights by creating a vector w where each element is 1, with a length equal to the number of rows in the roadacc data. This means that each road accident will be equally weight in the KDE calculation.\nWe also generate a sample range starting from the minimum to maximum month in inc_month column of the roadacc dataset, with increments of 0.5. As a recap, inc_month represents the month of the occurrence of the incident.\n\nw &lt;- rep(1,nrow(roadacc))\nsamples &lt;- seq(min(roadacc$inc_month),max(roadacc$inc_month),0.5)\n\nThe kernel density estimation is calculated for several bandwidths (bw 1 to bw 6 as seen in the codes below). Each bandwidth gives a different smoothing effect on the density estimate. bw 1 gives a more sensitive estimate, capturing fine details in the distribution of road accidents while larger bandwidth bw 6 will create a smoother density estimate by averaging over a wider range of data points.\n\nmonth_kernel_val &lt;- data.frame(\n  bw_1 = tkde(roadacc$inc_month, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 1, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_2 = tkde(roadacc$inc_month, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 2, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_3 = tkde(roadacc$inc_month, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 3, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_4 = tkde(roadacc$inc_month, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 4, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_5 = tkde(roadacc$inc_month, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 5, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_6 = tkde(roadacc$inc_month, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 6, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  month = samples\n)\n\n\ndf_month &lt;- reshape2::melt(month_kernel_val, id.vars = \"month\")\n\ndf_month$variable &lt;- as.factor(df_month$variable)\n\nggplot(data = df_month)+\n  geom_line(aes(x=month,y=value))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks =1:12, labels = c(\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\")) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(variable),ncol=2, scales=\"free\")+\n  labs(title = \"Temporal KDE for Occurrence of Road Accidents by Month\", x = \"Month\", y=\"Density\")+\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the plots above, we observe that:\n\nthe density curve for bw 1 is more jagged, reflecting more clearly the variations between the months - there are more significant drops in densities of road accidents in Feb, May and Nov while there are significant increases in densities of road accidents slightly before Apr, Oct and Dec.\nthe density curve starts to smooth out from bw 2. bw 3 and bw 4 seem to best capture the bimodal shape of the temporal dimension of road accidents before the bimodal shape starts to be less obvious in bw 5 and is entirely gone in bw 6 (this is hence why we stop at bw 6 and do not explore further bandwidths).\nfor bw 3 and 4, it is clear that occurrence of road accidents is most dense at the start (~Mar to Apr) and end of the year (towards the Oct period), while the occurrence of road accidents is less dense in the middle part of the year. This could be explained by the holiday seasons near the start and end of year that could have led to higher traffic on the roads. Further, the peak near Apr could be explained by the Songkran (Thai New Year) Festival that occurs annually in Apr, which could have led to more traffic and pedestrians on the road, increasing the chances of accidents.\n\n\n\n\nWe conduct a similar analysis to study the distribution of road accidents by day of week. It is important to recall that we assigned the week to start from Monday during the data wrangling steps in Part 1A.\n\nw &lt;- rep(1,nrow(roadacc))\nsamples &lt;- seq(min(roadacc$inc_dayofweek),max(roadacc$inc_dayofweek),0.5)\n\nday_kernel_val &lt;- data.frame(\n  bw_1 = tkde(roadacc$inc_dayofweek, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 1, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_2 = tkde(roadacc$inc_dayofweek, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 2, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_3 = tkde(roadacc$inc_dayofweek, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 3, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_4 = tkde(roadacc$inc_dayofweek, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 4, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  day = samples\n)\n\n\ndf_day &lt;- reshape2::melt(day_kernel_val, id.vars = \"day\")\ndf_day$variable &lt;- as.factor(df_day$variable)\n\nggplot(data = df_day)+\n  geom_line(aes(x=day,y=value))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks =1:7, labels = c(\"Mon\",\"Tues\",\"Wed\",\"Thu\",\"Fri\",\"Sat\",\"Sun\")) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(variable),ncol=2, scales=\"free\")+\n  labs(title = \"Temporal KDE for Occurrence of Road Accidents by Day of the Week\", x = \"Day\", y=\"Density\")+\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the plots above, we observe that:\n\nthe density curve for bw 1 is more jagged, reflecting more clearly the variations between the days - there are more significant increases in densities of road accidents from Fri to Sat. This could be explained by Fri and Sat being the start of the weekend and more traffic and pedestrians being out on the road for social activities.\nthe density curve starts to smooth out in bw 2 and seem to best capture the bimodal shape of the temporal dimension of road accidents - the density of road accidents increase between Fri to Sat and then drop on Sun and Mon before increasing on Tues again. As stated in the above point, the increase between Fri and Sat can be explained by these days being the start of the weekend, the drop in Sun and Mon could be due to less traffic as people start to get ready for the work/school week ahead and potentially even Mon blues when less people might travel to work. The increase in road accidents from Tues could be due to the steady stream of office workers/school children heading to office/school.\nThe bimodal shape becomes less obvious/almost entirely gone in bw3 and 4 (this is hence why we stop at bw 4 and do not explore further bandwidths).\n\n\n\n\nWe conduct a similar analysis to study the distribution of road accidents by time of day.\n\nw &lt;- rep(1,nrow(roadacc))\nsamples &lt;- seq(min(roadacc$inc_time),max(roadacc$inc_time),0.5)\n\ntime_kernel_val &lt;- data.frame(\n  bw_1 = tkde(roadacc$inc_time, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 1, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_2 = tkde(roadacc$inc_time, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 2, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_3 = tkde(roadacc$inc_time, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 3, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_4 = tkde(roadacc$inc_time, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 4, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_5 = tkde(roadacc$inc_time, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 5, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  bw_6 = tkde(roadacc$inc_time, w=w, samples = samples, bw = 6, kernel_name = \"quartic\"),\n  time = samples\n)\n\n\ndf_time &lt;- reshape2::melt(time_kernel_val, id.vars = \"time\")\ndf_time$variable &lt;- as.factor(df_time$variable)\n\nggplot(data = df_time)+\n  geom_line(aes(x=time,y=value))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks =1:24) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(variable),ncol=2, scales=\"free\")+\n  labs(title = \"Temporal KDE for Occurrence of Road Accidents by Time of Day\", x = \"Time\", y=\"Density\")+\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the plots above, we observe that:\n\nthe density curve for bw 1 is more jagged, reflecting more clearly the variations between the hours of the day - there are more significant increases in densities of road accidents from 7am. This could be explained by 7am being the start of the day and more traffic and pedestrians being out on the road for their daily activities.\nthe density curve starts to smooth out from bw 2 showing the period of 7am to 11am as the peak of the density of road accidents, how it dips from 12pm to 1pm (which could be explained by it being lunch hour and regular workers might be having their lunch rather than being out on the road) and the slight increase between 6pm to 8pm which is the knock-off time for office workers, hence leading to more traffic and pedestrians on the road. the density of road accidents dip significantly from 11pm which could be explained by it being the end of the day for most people hence leading to less traffic on the road and lower chances of road accidents occurring.\nthe density curve starts to smooth out significantly from bw 3 onwards before forming an entirely smooth hump in bw 6 (this is hence why we stop at bw 6 and do not explore further bandwidths)."

(especially towards Mar to Apr) and end of the year (towards the Oct period), while the occurrence of road accidents is less dense in the middle part of the year.\n\n\nDense occurrence of road accidents in the later half of the year i.e Oct to Dec, as compared to the earlier half of the year.\n\nWhile there are differences in temporal KDE and Spatio-Temporal KDE plots, together they indicate the following:\n\nRoad accidents tend to occur more intensely at the end of the year, with lower occurrences in the middle segment of the year.\nThere could be a high overall accident count in Mar to Apr but the spatial distribution during this period might be more dispersed, leading to less prominent hotspots in the KDE maps.\nOct to Dec seem to have high overall accident counts that are concentrated leading to very prominent hotspots in the KDE map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe run similar steps in section 11.1 above to study the distribution of road accidents by day of week.\n\ntm_shape(provincedata32647)+\n  tm_polygons()+\n  tm_shape(roadacc)+\n  tm_dots(size=0.05,col = \"blue\",alpha =0.5)+\n  tm_facets(by=\"inc_dayofweek\",\n            free.coords = FALSE,\n

observations\n\n\n\n\n\nOccurrence of road accidents is most dense on Fri and Sat\n\n\nDense occurrence of road accidents from Fri to Mon, however road accidents on Sun and Mon seem to be more spatially concentrated than Fri and Sat\n\nWhile there are differences in temporal KDE and Spatio-Temporal KDE plots, together they indicate the following:\n\nRoad accidents occur in high accident counts at the start of the weekend\nThe spatial distribution of road accidents on Sun and Mon are more concentrated as compared to Fri and Sat, leading to more prominent hotspots in the KDE map.\n\nThis could potentially be explained by Fri and Sat being the start of the weekend vs Sun and Mon which are closer to the start of the week and while people may venture out to different places to carry out their social activities on Fri and Sat, they may travel to a smaller subset of locations i.e. home on Sun to rest before the start of the week or to work/school on Mon for the start of the week, hence leading to more concentrated occurrences of road accidents on Sun and Mon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe run similar steps as above to study the distribution of road accidents by time of

Wide curve and grade-separated intersection/ramps are also top road descriptions for road accidents.\n\n\nRoad accidents across BMR are not randomly distributed and exhibit clustering\nRoad accidents occur more intensely along the road lines in Bangkok and Samut Prakan\n\nDense occurrence of road accidents within central Bangkok along intricate road networks\n\nOverall, observe denser occurrence of road accidents at intersections of road segments\n\n-\n\nPrioritise road accident prevention efforts on Bangkok and Samut Prakan, followed by Pathum Thani, Samut Sakhon, Nakhon Pathom and finally Nonthaburi\nWithin the provinces, to conduct in-depth study on conditions of straight roads and roads with no slopes, especially at points where such roads meet at intersections. This can be followed by studies on roads with wide curve and grade-separated intersection/ramps.\nPreventive measures can be:\n\nPublic education campaigns that highlight the risks of road accidents even on seemingly safe straight roads, to increase driver’s and pedestrians’ awareness of risks and not to be complacent.\nClearer signs can be placed along straight roads to remind drivers and pedestrians of safe road practices.\nPlace more cameras along these roads to capture errant/risky behaviour and to send warning/enforcement letters to prevent the same driver/pedestrian from making similar/more severe mistakes in future\n\n\n\n\n2\nTime\n\nRoad accidents tend to occur more often near the start and end of the year\n\nIncreasing trend of road accidents in the later months i.e. Oct to Dec, over the years\n\nRoad accidents seem to occur more on Fri and Sat\nRoad accidents seem to occur more often between 7am to 11pm, with the top two timings at 9am and 7pm\n\n-\n\nRoad accidents tend to occur more intensely at the end of the year, with lower occurrences in the middle segment of the year.\n\nThere could be a high overall accident count at the start of the year but the spatial distribution during this period might be more dispersed\nRoad accidents near the end of the year seem to be more concentrated\n\nRoad accidents occur in high accident counts at the start of the weekend\n\nThe spatial distribution of road accidents on Sun and Mon are more concentrated as compared to Fri and Sat\n\nOccurrence of road accidents is more intense during the hours from 7am to 11pm\n\n\nTo focus on preventive efforts in the later months of the year i.e. ramp up public education campaigns, to patrol the roads more often or to set up more traffic control points as compared to the early months of the year\nTo step up road control measures from Fri to Mon\n\nFor Fri and Sat, the spatial distribution of road accidents are more dispersed hence might require more manpower to form a larger patrol group or more traffic check points to monitor traffic and prevent accidents\nFor Sun and Mon, the spatial distribution of road accidents is more concentrated. A study can be carried out to shortlist the hotspots and patrol or traffice control efforts can be more focused on these areas on these two days\n\nAs the peak hours are at 9am and 7pm, Thai government can considering introducing policies to encourage the population to head to work or school at earlier or later timings to stagger traffic and reduce the risks of accidents. For instance, offering discount toll rates or public transport fees at earlier or later offpeak timings to entice population to utilise the transport modes at different timings.\n\n\n\n3\nWeather conditions\n\nRoad accidents most frequently occur during clear weather conditions followed by rainy and dark conditions\n\n-\n-\n\nTo focus on needle-moving strategies that can prevent road accidents during clear weather conditions i.e. to install more warning signs and speed cameras along the locations stated in S/N 1 for deterrence.\n\n\n\n4\nHuman factors\n\nRoad accidents mostly involve private/passenger car, followed by 4-wheel pickup truck and motorcycle as top 3 vehicles\nTop presumed cause is speeding\nTop accident types are rear-end collision and rollover/fallen on straight road\n\n-\n-\n\nTo focus public education efforts on drivers with private/passenger car, 4-wheel pickup truck and motorcycle licenses i.e. mailers to these group of drivers. As a pre-emptive measure, to place greater emphasis on safety practices and road guidelines when prospective drivers apply for the licenses for these vehicles.\nTo set up more speed cameras along locations in S/N 1 to identify errant drivers and as a form of deterrence."

    "text": "Advice from Prof Kam on Take-home Ex01:\n\n\n\n\nthere is a highway at the top of the 6 provinces - should have created a ~50m buffer around the 6 provinces then use the buffered area to clip the road lines in Bangkok Metropolitan Region\nshould sieve out short road lengths from road lines data\nalways plot data out, examine it in relation to the context to know whether data is properly prepared\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will compute Global Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation (GMSA) using spdep package. The learning points of this hands-on exercise are to:\n\nimport geospatial data using appropriate function(s) of sf package,\nimport csv file using appropriate function of readr package,\nperform relational join using appropriate join function of dplyr package,\ncompute Global Spatial Autocorrelation (GSA) statistics by using appropriate functions of spdep package,\n\nplot Moran scatterplot,\ncompute and plot spatial correlogram using appropriate function of spdep package.\n\nprovide statistically correct interpretation of GSA statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn spatial policy, one of the main development objective of the local government and planners is to ensure equal distribution of development in the province. Our task in this study, hence, is to apply appropriate spatial statistical methods to discover if development are even distributed geographically. If the answer is No. Then, our next question will be “is there sign of spatial clustering?”. And, if the answer for this question is yes, then our next question will be “where are these clusters?”\nIn this case study, we are interested to examine the spatial pattern of a selected development indicator (i.e. GDP per capita) of Hunan Provice, People Republic of China.\n\n\n\nTwo data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise, they are:\n\nHunan province administrative boundary layer at county level. This is a geospatial data set in ESRI shapefile format.\nHunan_2012.csv: This csv file contains selected Hunan’s local development indicators in 2012.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we get started, we need to ensure that spdep, sf, tmap and tidyverse packages of R are installed in R.\n\nsf is use for importing and handling geospatial data in R,\ntidyverse is mainly use for wrangling attribute data in R,\nspdep will be used to compute spatial weights, global and local spatial autocorrelation statistics, and\ntmap will be used to prepare cartographic quality chropleth map.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to perform the following tasks:\n\ncreating a package list containing the necessary R packages,\nchecking if the R packages in the package list have been installed in R,\n\nif they have yet to be installed, RStudio will installed the missing packages,\n\nlaunching the packages into R environment.\n\n\npacman::p_load(sf,tidyverse,spdep,tmap,sfdep)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will bring a geospatial data and its associated attribute table into R environment. The geospatial data is in ESRI shapefile format and the attribute table is in csv fomat.\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses st_read() of sf package to import Hunan shapefile into R. The imported shapefile will be a simple features object of sf.\n\nhunan &lt;- st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\",\n                 layer = \"Hunan\")\n\nReading layer `Hunan' from data source \n  `C:\\mooseksm\\ISSS626-GAA\\In-class_Ex\\In-class_Ex05\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 88 features and 7 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 108.7831 ymin: 24.6342 xmax: 114.2544 ymax: 30.12812\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\nWe note that the simple features data has a polygon geometry and has 88 features and 7 fields. It is in WGS84 geographic coordinate system.\n\n\n\nNext, we will import Hunan_2012.csv into R using read_csv() of readr package. The output is in R data frame class.\n\nhunan2012 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to update the attribute table of hunan’s SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with the attribute fields of hunan2012 dataframe.

This will be performed using left_join() function of dplyr package.\nThe shan_sf simple feature dataframe will be used as the base data object and the ict_derived dataframe will be used as the join table.\nThe unique identifier and common field used to join both data objects is TS_PCODE. We saved the file as a new rds file to avoid rerunning the preparation steps.\n\nshan_sf &lt;- left_join(shan_sf,\n                              ict_derived,\n                              by = c(\"TS_PCODE\"=\"TS_PCODE\"))\n\nwrite_rds(shan_sf,\"data/rds/shan_sf.rds\")\n\nIt is important to note that no new output data has been created. Instead, the data fields from ict_derived dataframe are now updated into the shan_sf dataframe.\n\nshan_sf &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/shan_sf.rds\")\n\n\n\n\nWe will prepare a choropleth map to take a quick look at the distribution of radio penetration rate of Shan State at the township level.\nWe use the qtm() function of the tmap package below:\n\nqtm(shan_sf,\"RADIO_PR\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to reveal that the distribution shown in the choropleth map above is bias to the underlying total number of households at the township, we will create two choropleth maps - one for the total number of households TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map and one for the total number of households with Radio i.e. RADIO.map using the code chunk below:\n\nTT_HOUSEHOLDS.map &lt;- tm_shape(shan_sf)+\n  tm_fill(col = \"TT_HOUSEHOLDS\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\",\n          title = \"Total households\")+\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)+\n  tm_layout(legend.position =c(0.8,0.5))\n\nRADIO.map &lt;- tm_shape(shan_sf)+\n  tm_fill(col = \"RADIO\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\",\n          title = \"Number of households with Radio\")+\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)+\n  tm_layout(legend.position =c(0.8,0.5))\n\ntmap_arrange(TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map,RADIO.map,\n             asp = NA,\n             ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choropleth maps above show that townships with relatively larger number of households are also showing relatively higher number of radio ownership.\nNow we plot the choropleth maps showing the distribution of total number of households and radio penetration rate using the code chunk below:\n\ntm_shape(shan_sf)+\n  tm_polygons(c(\"TT_HOUSEHOLDS\",\"RADIO_PR\"),\n              style=\"jenks\")+\n  tm_facets(sync = TRUE,\n            ncol = 2)+\n  tm_legend(legend.position = c(\"right\",\"bottom\"))+\n  tm_layout(outer.margins = 0,\n            asp = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown above, choropleth maps above show that townships with relatively larger number of households might not have a higher number of radio penetration rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we perform cluster analysis, it is important to ensure that the cluster variables are not highly correlated.\nWe will use corrplot.mixed() function of corrplot package to visualise and analyse the correlation of the input variables.\n\ncluster_vars.cor = cor(ict_derived[,12:17])\ncorrplot.mixed(cluster_vars.cor,\n               lower = \"ellipse\",\n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correlation plot shows that COMPUTER_PR and INTERNET_PR are highly correlated i.e. more than 0.8, in this case 0.87.

In this exercise, hclust() of R stats will be used.\nhclust() employs the agglomeration method to compute the cluster. Eight clustering algorithms are supportedm namely ward.D, ward.D2, single, complete, average(UPGMA), mcquitty(WPGMA), median(WPGMC) and centroid(UPGMC).\nThe code chunk below performs the hierarchical cluster analysis using ward.D method. The hierarchical clustering output is stored in an object of class hclust which describes the tree produced by the clustering process.\n\nhclust_ward &lt;- hclust(proxmat, method=\"ward.D\")\n\nWe plot the tree using plot() of R Graphics using the code chunk below:\n\nplot(hclust_ward,cex = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne challenge in performing hierarchical clustering is to identify stronger clustering structures. The issue can be solved by using agnes() function of cluster package.\nIt functions like hclust() but with the agnes() function, we also get the agglomerative coefficient which measures the amount of clustering structure found i.e. values closer to 1 suggest a stronger clustering structure.\nThe code chunk below is used to compute the agglomerative coefficient of all hierarchical clustering algorithms:\n\nm &lt;- c(\"average\",\"single\",\"complete\",\"ward\")\nnames(m) &lt;- c(\"average\",\"single\",\"complete\",\"ward\")\n\nac &lt;- function(x){\n  agnes(shan_ict,method=x)$ac\n}\n\nmap_dbl(m,ac)\n\n  average    single  complete      ward \n0.8131144 0.6628705 0.8950702 0.9427730 \n\n\nWith reference to the output above, we can see that Ward’s method provides the strongest clustering structure among the four methods assessed. Hence, in the subsequent analysis, only Ward’s method will be used.\n\n\n\nAnother technical challenge face by data analyst in performing clustering analysis is to determine the optimal clusters to retain.\nThere are three commonly used methods to determine the optimal clusters, they are:\n\nElbow Method\nAverage Silhouette Method\nGap Statistic Method\n\n\n\nThe gap statistic compares the total within intra-cluster variation for different values of k with their expected values under null reference distribution of the data. The estimate of the optimal clusters will be value that maximize the gap statistic (i.e., that yields the largest gap statistic). This means that the clustering structure is far away from the random uniform distribution of points.\nTo compute the gap statistic, clusGap() of cluster package will be used.\n\nset.seed(12345)\ngap_stat &lt;- clusGap(shan_ict,\n                    FUN = hcut,\n                    nstart = 25,\n                    K.max = 10,\n                    B = 50)\n\nprint(gap_stat,method=\"firstmax\")\n\nClustering Gap statistic [\"clusGap\"] from call:\nclusGap(x = shan_ict, FUNcluster = hcut, K.max = 10, B = 50, nstart = 25)\nB=50 simulated reference sets, k = 1..10; spaceH0=\"scaledPCA\"\n --&gt; Number of clusters (method 'firstmax'): 1\n          logW   E.logW       gap     SE.sim\n [1,] 8.407129 8.680794 0.2736651 0.04460994\n [2,] 8.130029 8.350712 0.2206824 0.03880130\n [3,] 7.992265 8.202550 0.2102844 0.03362652\n [4,] 7.862224 8.080655 0.2184311 0.03784781\n [5,] 7.756461 7.978022 0.2215615 0.03897071\n [6,] 7.665594 7.887777 0.2221833 0.03973087\n [7,] 7.590919 7.806333 0.2154145 0.04054939\n [8,] 7.526680 7.731619 0.2049390 0.04198644\n [9,] 7.458024 7.660795 0.2027705 0.04421874\n[10,] 7.377412 7.593858 0.2164465 0.04540947\n\n\nNote that the hcut function used is from the factoextra package.\nNext, we can visualise the plot using fviz_gap_stat() of factoextra package:\n\nfviz_gap_stat(gap_stat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith reference to the gap statistic graph above, the recommended number of cluster to retain is 1. However, it is not logical to retain only one cluster. By examine the gap statistic graph, the 6-cluster gives the next largest gap statistic and should be the next best cluster to pick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote: In addition to these commonly used approaches, the NbClust package, published by Charrad et al., 2014, provides 30 indices for determining the relevant number of clusters and proposes to users the best clustering scheme from the different results obtained by varying all combinations of number of clusters, distance measures, and clustering methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class 6 notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\ndendogram without a cut-off is not useful\nthere will be several local optimisation points i.e. if extend to view more number of clusters, will likely see local optimal points there too. hence need to consider logic/other factors i.e. if have 80 points, no point having 20 clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the dendrogram displayed above, each leaf corresponds to one observation. As we move up the tree, observations that are similar to each other are combined into branches, which are themselves fused at a higher height.\nThe height of the fusion, provided on the vertical axis, indicates the (dis)similarity between two observations. The higher the height of the fusion, the less similar the observations are. Note that, conclusions about the proximity of two observations can be drawn only based on the height where branches containing those two observations first are fused. We cannot use the proximity of two observations along the horizontal axis as a criteria of their similarity.\nIt’s also possible to draw the dendrogram with a border around the selected clusters by using rect.hclust() of R stats. The argument border is used to specify the border colors for the rectangles.\n\nplot(hclust_ward, cex = 0.6)\nrect.hclust(hclust_ward,\n            k = 6,\n            border = 2:5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to perform visually-driven hiearchical clustering analysis using heatmaply package.\nWith heatmaply, we are able to build both highly interactive or static cluster heatmap.\n\n\nThe data was loaded into a data frame, but it has to be a data matrix to make your heatmap.\nThe code chunk below will be used to transform shan_ict data frame into a data matrix.\n\nshan_ict_mat &lt;- data.matrix(shan_ict)\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmaply() of heatmaply package is used to build an interactive cluster heatmap.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(shan_ict_mat),\n          Colv = NA,\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\",\n          seriate = \"OLO\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 6,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main = \"Geographic Segmentation of Shan State by ICT Indicators\",\n          xlab = \"ICT Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"Townships of Shan State\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith closed examination of the dendragram above, we have decided to retain six clusters.\ncutree() of R Base will be used in the code chunk below to derive a 6-cluster model.\n\ngroups &lt;- as.factor(cutree(hclust_ward, k=6))\n\nThe output is called groups. It is a list object.\nIn order to visualise the clusters, the groups object need to be appended onto shan_sf simple feature object.\nThe code chunk below form the join in three steps:\n\nthe groups list object will be converted into a matrix;\ncbind() is used to append groups matrix onto shan_sf to produce an output simple feature object called shan_sf_cluster; and\nrename() of dplyr package is used to rename as.matrix.groups field as CLUSTER.\n\n\nshan_sf_cluster &lt;- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %&gt;%\n  rename(`CLUSTER`=`as.matrix.groups.`)\n\nNext, qtm() of tmap package is used to plot the choropleth map showing the cluster formed:\n\nqtm(shan_sf_cluster,\"CLUSTER\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choropleth map above reveals the clusters are very fragmented. The is one of the major limitations when non-spatial clustering algorithm such as hierarchical cluster analysis method is used.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will derive spatially constrained cluster using skater() method of spdep package.\n\n\nFirst, we need to convert shan_sf into SpatialPolygonsDataFrame. This is because SKATER function only support sp objects such as SpatialPolygonDataFrame.\nThe code chunk below uses as_Spatial() of sf package to convert shan_sf into a SpatialPolygonDataFrame called shan_sp.\n\nshan_sp &lt;- as_Spatial(shan_sf)\n\n\n\n\nNext, poly2nd() of spdep package will be used to compute the neighbours list from polygon list.\n\nshan.nb &lt;- poly2nb(shan_sp)\nsummary(shan.nb)\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 55 \nNumber of nonzero links: 264 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 8.727273 \nAverage number of links: 4.8 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \n 5  9  7 21  4  3  5  1 \n5 least connected regions:\n3 5 7 9 47 with 2 links\n1 most connected region:\n8 with 9 links\n\n\nWe can plot the neighbours list on shan_sp using the code chunk below. Since we now can plot the community area boundaries as well, we plot this graph on top of the map. The first plot command gives the boundaries. This is followed by the plot of the neighbor list object, with coordinates applied to the original SpatialPolygonDataFrame (Shan state township boundaries) to extract the centroids of the polygons. These are used as the nodes for the graph representation. We also set the color to blue and specify add=TRUE to plot the network on top of the boundaries.\n\ncoords &lt;- st_coordinates(\n  st_centroid(st_geometry(shan_sf)))\n\n\nplot(st_geometry(shan_sf), \n     border=grey(.5))\nplot(shan.nb,\n     coords, \n     col=\"blue\", \n     add=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if you plot the network first and then the boundaries, some of the areas will be clipped. This is because the plotting area is determined by the characteristics of the first plot. In this example, because the boundary map extends further than the graph, we plot it first.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, nbcosts() of spdep package is used to compute the cost of each edge. It is the distance between it nodes. This function compute this distance using a data.frame with observations vector in each node.\nThe code chunk below is used to compute the cost of each edge.\n\nlcosts &lt;- nbcosts(shan.nb, shan_ict)\n\nFor each observation, this gives the pairwise dissimilarity between its values on the five variables and the values for the neighbouring observation (from the neighbour list). Basically, this is the notion of a generalised weight for a spatial weights matrix.\nNext, we will incorporate these costs into a weights object in the same way as we did in the calculation of inverse of distance weights. In other words, we convert the neighbour list to a list weights object by specifying the just computed lcosts as the weights.\nIn order to achieve this, nb2listw() of spdep package is used as shown in the code chunk below.\nNote that we specify the style as B to make sure the cost values are not row-standardised.\n\nshan.w &lt;- nb2listw(shan.nb, \n                   lcosts, \n                   style=\"B\")\nsummary(shan.w)\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 55 \nNumber of nonzero links: 264 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 8.727273 \nAverage number of links: 4.8 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \n 5  9  7 21  4  3  5  1 \n5 least connected regions:\n3 5 7 9 47 with 2 links\n1 most connected region:\n8 with 9 links\n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn       S0       S1        S2\nB 55 3025 76267.65 58260785 522016004\n\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is computed by mean of the mstree() of spdep package as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nshan.mst &lt;- mstree(shan.w)\n\nAfter computing the MST, we can check its class and dimension by using the code chunk below.\n\nclass(shan.mst)\n\n[1] \"mst\"    \"matrix\"\n\n\n\ndim(shan.mst)\n\n[1] 54  3\n\n\nNote that the dimension is 54 and not 55. This is because the minimum spanning tree consists on n-1 edges (links) in order to traverse all the nodes.\nWe can display the content of shan.mst by using head() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nhead(shan.mst)\n\n     [,1] [,2]      [,3]\n[1,]   54   48  47.79331\n[2,]   54   17 109.08506\n[3,]   54   45 127.42203\n[4,]   45   52 146.78891\n[5,]   52   13 110.55197\n[6,]   13   28  92.79567\n\n\nThe plot method for the MST include a way to show the observation numbers of the nodes in addition to the edge. As before, we plot this together with the township boundaries. We can see how the initial neighbour list is simplified to just one edge connecting each of the nodes, while passing through all the nodes.\n\nplot(st_geometry(shan_sf), \n                 border=gray(.5))\nplot.mst(shan.mst, \n         coords, \n         col=\"blue\", \n         cex.lab=0.7, \n         cex.circles=0.005, \n         add=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below compute the spatially constrained cluster using skater() of spdep package.\n\nclust6 &lt;- spdep::skater(edges = shan.mst[,1:2], \n                 data = shan_ict, \n                 method = \"euclidean\", \n                 ncuts = 5)\n\nThe skater() takes three mandatory arguments: - the first two columns of the MST matrix (i.e. not the cost), - the data matrix (to update the costs as units are being grouped), and - the number of cuts.\nNote: It is set to one less than the number of clusters. So, the value specified is not the number of clusters, but the number of cuts in the graph, one less than the number of clusters.\nThe result of the skater() is an object of class skater. We can examine its contents by using the code chunk below.\n\nstr(clust6)\n\nList of 8\n $ groups      : num [1:55] 3 3 6 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ edges.groups:List of 6\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num [1:22] 13 48 54 55 45 37 34 16 25 52 ...\n  .. ..$ edge: num [1:21, 1:3] 48 55 54 37 34 16 45 25 13 13 ...\n  .. ..$ ssw : num 3423\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num [1:18] 47 27 53 38 42 15 41 51 43 32 ...\n  .. ..$ edge: num [1:17, 1:3] 53 15 42 38 41 51 15 27 15 43 ...\n  .. ..$ ssw : num 3759\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num [1:11] 2 6 8 1 36 4 10 9 46 5 ...\n  .. ..$ edge: num [1:10, 1:3] 6 1 8 36 4 6 8 10 10 9 ...\n  .. ..$ ssw : num 1458\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num [1:2] 44 20\n  .. ..$ edge: num [1, 1:3] 44 20 95\n  .. ..$ ssw : num 95\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num 23\n  .. ..$ edge: num[0 , 1:3] \n  .. ..$ ssw : num 0\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num 3\n  .. ..$ edge: num[0 , 1:3] \n  .. ..$ ssw : num 0\n $ not.prune   : NULL\n $ candidates  : int [1:6] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n $ ssto        : num 12613\n $ ssw         : num [1:6] 12613 10977 9962 9540 9123 ...\n $ crit        : num [1:2] 1 Inf\n $ vec.crit    : num [1:55] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"skater\"\n\n\nThe most interesting component of this list structure is the groups vector containing the labels of the cluster to which each observation belongs (as before, the label itself is arbitary). This is followed by a detailed summary for each of the clusters in the edges.groups list. Sum of squares measures are given as ssto for the total and ssw to show the effect of each of the cuts on the overall criterion.\nWe can check the cluster assignment by using the conde chunk below.\n\nccs6 &lt;- clust6$groups\nccs6\n\n [1] 3 3 6 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 4 1 2 5 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 3 1 2\n[39] 2 2 2 2 2 4 1 3 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1\n\n\nWe can find out how many observations are in each cluster by means of the table command. Parenthetially, we can also find this as the dimension of each vector in the lists contained in edges.groups. For example, the first list has node with dimension 22, which is also the number of observations in the first cluster.\n\ntable(ccs6)\n\nccs6\n 1  2  3  4  5  6 \n22 18 11  2  1  1 \n\n\nLastly, we can also plot the pruned tree that shows the five clusters on top of the townshop area.\n\nplot(st_geometry(shan_sf), \n     border=gray(.5))\nplot(clust6, \n     coords, \n     cex.lab=.7,\n     groups.colors=c(\"red\",\"green\",\"blue\", \"brown\", \"pink\"),\n     cex.circles=0.005, \n     add=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below is used to plot the newly derived clusters by using SKATER method.\n\ngroups_mat &lt;- as.matrix(clust6$groups)\nshan_sf_spatialcluster &lt;- cbind(shan_sf_cluster, as.factor(groups_mat)) %&gt;%\n  rename(`SP_CLUSTER`=`as.factor.groups_mat.`)\nqtm(shan_sf_spatialcluster, \"SP_CLUSTER\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor easy comparison, it will be better to place both the hierarchical clustering and spatially constrained hierarchical clustering maps next to each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nhclust.map &lt;- qtm(shan_sf_cluster,\n                  \"CLUSTER\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) \n\nshclust.map &lt;- qtm(shan_sf_spatialcluster,\n                   \"SP_CLUSTER\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) \n\ntmap_arrange(hclust.map, shclust.map,\n             asp=NA, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class 6 notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\nresults from spatially constrained cluster is more homogenous, determined based on shortest path distance\nmajor limitation of this method is that might be spatially homogenous but might not be that homogenous in terms of attribute aka “hard classification” hence alternative to this is to use ClustGeo() aka “soft classification” method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will use functions provided by ClustGeo package to perform non-spatially constrained hierarchical cluster analysis and spatially constrained cluster analysis.\n\n\nClustGeo package is an R package specially designed to support the need of performing spatially constrained cluster analysis. More specifically, it provides a Ward-like hierarchical clustering algorithm called hclustgeo() including spatial/geographical constraints.\nIn the nutshell, the algorithm uses two dissimilarity matrices D0 and D1 along with a mixing parameter alpha, whereby the value of alpha must be a real number between [0, 1]. D0 can be non-Euclidean and the weights of the observations can be non-uniform. It gives the dissimilarities in the attribute/clustering variable space. D1, on the other hand, gives the dissimilarities in the constraint space. The criterion minimised at each stage is a convex combination of the homogeneity criterion calculated with D0 and the homogeneity criterion calculated with D1.\nThe idea is then to determine a value of alpha which increases the spatial contiguity without deteriorating too much the quality of the solution based on the variables of interest. This need is supported by a function called choicealpha().\n\n\n\nClustGeo package provides function called hclustgeo() to perform a typical Ward-like hierarchical clustering just like hclust() learned in previous section.\nTo perform non-spatially constrained hierarchical clustering, we only need to provide the function a dissimilarity matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nnongeo_cluster &lt;- hclustgeo(proxmat)\nplot(nongeo_cluster, cex = 0.5)\nrect.hclust(nongeo_cluster, \n            k = 6, \n            border = 2:5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the dissimilarity matrix must be an object of class dist, i.e. an object obtained with the function dist(). For sample code chunk, please refer to 5.7.6 Computing proximity matrix\n\n\nSimilarly, we can plot the clusters on a categorical area shaded map by using the steps we learned in 5.7.12 Mapping the clusters formed.\n\ngroups &lt;- as.factor(cutree(nongeo_cluster, k=6))\n\n\nshan_sf_ngeo_cluster &lt;- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %&gt;%\n  rename(`CLUSTER` = `as.matrix.groups.`)\n\n\nqtm(shan_sf_ngeo_cluster, \"CLUSTER\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can performed spatially constrained hierarchical clustering, a spatial distance matrix will be derived by using st_distance() of sf package.\n\ndist &lt;- st_distance(shan_sf, shan_sf)\ndistmat &lt;- as.dist(dist)\n\nNotice that as.dist() is used to convert the data frame into matrix.\nNext, choicealpha() will be used to determine a suitable value for the mixing parameter alpha as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncr &lt;- choicealpha(proxmat, distmat, range.alpha = seq(0, 1, 0.1), K=6, graph = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith reference to the graphs above, alpha = 0.3 will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class 6 notes from Prof Kam\n\n\n\nInterpreting the plots above:\n\nuse the raw version of the plot above to decide on the cut-off for alpha. the bottom plot is the normalised version.\nfor the raw version, towards the right, the red plot has stronger spatial compactness but lose attribute homogeneity. If want to focus on attribute compactness, look more towards the left. hence to objectively decide, look for the point where both plots cut each other i.e. compromise between spatial and attribute compactness\nk=6 will be obtained from the step above as there is no spatially constrained optimal number of clusters\n\n\n\n\nclustG &lt;- hclustgeo(proxmat, distmat, alpha = 0.3)\n\nNext, cutree() is used to derive the cluster object.\n\ngroups &lt;- as.factor(cutree(clustG, k=6))\n\nWe will then join back the group list with shan_sf polygon feature data frame by using the code chunk below.\n\nshan_sf_Gcluster &lt;- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %&gt;%\n  rename(`CLUSTER` = `as.matrix.groups.`)\n\nWe can now plot the map of the newly delineated spatially constrained clusters.\n\nqtm(shan_sf_Gcluster, \"CLUSTER\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk below is used to reveal the distribution of a clustering variable (i.e RADIO_PR) by cluster.\n\nggplot(data = shan_sf_ngeo_cluster,\n       aes(x = CLUSTER, y = RADIO_PR)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot reveals Cluster 3 displays the highest mean Radio Ownership Per Thousand Household. This is followed by Cluster 2, 1, 4, 6 and 5.\n\n\n\nPast studies shown that parallel coordinate plot can be used to reveal clustering variables by cluster very effectively. In the code chunk below, ggparcoord() of GGally package\n\nggparcoord(data = shan_sf_ngeo_cluster, \n           columns = c(17:21), \n           scale = \"globalminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of ICT Variables by Cluster\") +\n  facet_grid(~ CLUSTER) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parallel coordinate plot above reveals that households in Cluster 4 townships tend to own the highest number of TV and mobile-phone. On the other hand, households in Cluster 5 tends to own the lowest of all the five ICT.\nNote that the scale argument of ggparcoor() provide several methods to scale the clustering variables. They are:\n\nstd: univariately, subtract mean and divide by standard deviation.\nrobust: univariately, subtract median and divide by median absolute deviation.\nuniminmax: univariately, scale so the minimum of the variable is zero, and the maximum is one.\nglobalminmax: no scaling is done; the range of the graphs is defined by the global minimum and the global maximum.\ncenter: use uniminmax to standardize vertical height, then center each variable at a value specified by the scaleSummary param.\ncenterObs: use uniminmax to standardize vertical height, then center each variable at the value of the observation specified by the centerObsID param\n\nThere is no one best scaling method to use - we will need to explore them and select the one that best meets the analysis need.\nLast but not least, we can also compute the summary statistics such as mean, median, sd, etc to complement the visual interpretation.\nIn the code chunk below, group_by() and summarise() of dplyr are used to derive mean values of the clustering variables.\n\nshan_sf_ngeo_cluster %&gt;% \n  st_set_geometry(NULL) %&gt;%\n  group_by(CLUSTER) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_RADIO_PR = mean(RADIO_PR),\n            mean_TV_PR = mean(TV_PR),\n            mean_LLPHONE_PR = mean(LLPHONE_PR),\n            mean_MPHONE_PR = mean(MPHONE_PR),\n            mean_COMPUTER_PR = mean(COMPUTER_PR))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  CLUSTER mean_RADIO_PR mean_TV_PR mean_LLPHONE_PR mean_MPHONE_PR\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 1               221.        521.            44.2           246.\n2 2               237.        402.            23.9           134.\n3 3               300.        611.            52.2           392.\n4 4               196.        744.            99.0           651.\n5 5               124.        224.            38.0           132.\n6 6                98.6       499.            74.5           468.\n# ℹ 1 more variable: mean_COMPUTER_PR &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class 6 notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\nstandardisation is important for hierarchical clustering because its distance-based and when units of measurement are different, you want to avoid the data analysis being skewed by data with larger units\nhowever in this case, while we had carried out standardisation in this exercise, we note that the distribution of the variables are not wide-ranging and hence can just use the unstandardised data for analysis\nvariable standaridsation techniques: Z-score has no max while min-max is constrained between 0 and 1. another standardisation method decimal scaling helps to spread the data i.e. data from satellites, remote sensing technologies"

In this exercise, hclust() of R stats will be used.\nhclust() employs the agglomeration method to compute the cluster. Eight clustering algorithms are supportedm namely ward.D, ward.D2, single, complete, average(UPGMA), mcquitty(WPGMA), median(WPGMC) and centroid(UPGMC).\nThe code chunk below performs the hierarchical cluster analysis using ward.D method. The hierarchical clustering output is stored in an object of class hclust which describes the tree produced by the clustering process.\n\nhclust_ward &lt;- hclust(proxmat, method=\"ward.D\")\n\nWe plot the tree using plot() of R Graphics using the code chunk below:\n\nplot(hclust_ward,cex = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne challenge in performing hierarchical clustering is to identify stronger clustering structures. The issue can be solved by using agnes() function of cluster package.\nIt functions like hclust() but with the agnes() function, we also get the agglomerative coefficient which measures the amount of clustering structure found i.e. values closer to 1 suggest a stronger clustering structure.\nThe code chunk below is used to compute the agglomerative coefficient of all hierarchical clustering algorithms:\n\nm &lt;- c(\"average\",\"single\",\"complete\",\"ward\")\nnames(m) &lt;- c(\"average\",\"single\",\"complete\",\"ward\")\n\nac &lt;- function(x){\n  agnes(shan_ict,method=x)$ac\n}\n\nmap_dbl(m,ac)\n\n  average    single  complete      ward \n0.8131144 0.6628705 0.8950702 0.9427730 \n\n\nWith reference to the output above, we can see that Ward’s method provides the strongest clustering structure among the four methods assessed. Hence, in the subsequent analysis, only Ward’s method will be used.\n\n\n\nAnother technical challenge face by data analyst in performing clustering analysis is to determine the optimal clusters to retain.\nThere are three commonly used methods to determine the optimal clusters, they are:\n\nElbow Method\nAverage Silhouette Method\nGap Statistic Method\n\n\n\nThe gap statistic compares the total within intra-cluster variation for different values of k with their expected values under null reference distribution of the data. The estimate of the optimal clusters will be value that maximize the gap statistic (i.e., that yields the largest gap statistic). This means that the clustering structure is far away from the random uniform distribution of points.\nTo compute the gap statistic, clusGap() of cluster package will be used.\n\nset.seed(12345)\ngap_stat &lt;- clusGap(shan_ict,\n                    FUN = hcut,\n                    nstart = 25,\n                    K.max = 10,\n                    B = 50)\n\nprint(gap_stat,method=\"firstmax\")\n\nClustering Gap statistic [\"clusGap\"] from call:\nclusGap(x = shan_ict, FUNcluster = hcut, K.max = 10, B = 50, nstart = 25)\nB=50 simulated reference sets, k = 1..10; spaceH0=\"scaledPCA\"\n --&gt; Number of clusters (method 'firstmax'): 1\n          logW   E.logW       gap     SE.sim\n [1,] 8.407129 8.680794 0.2736651 0.04460994\n [2,] 8.130029 8.350712 0.2206824 0.03880130\n [3,] 7.992265 8.202550 0.2102844 0.03362652\n [4,] 7.862224 8.080655 0.2184311 0.03784781\n [5,] 7.756461 7.978022 0.2215615 0.03897071\n [6,] 7.665594 7.887777 0.2221833 0.03973087\n [7,] 7.590919 7.806333 0.2154145 0.04054939\n [8,] 7.526680 7.731619 0.2049390 0.04198644\n [9,] 7.458024 7.660795 0.2027705 0.04421874\n[10,] 7.377412 7.593858 0.2164465 0.04540947\n\n\nNote that the hcut function used is from the factoextra package.\nNext, we can visualise the plot using fviz_gap_stat() of factoextra package:\n\nfviz_gap_stat(gap_stat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith reference to the gap statistic graph above, the recommended number of cluster to retain is 1. However, it is not logical to retain only one cluster. By examine the gap statistic graph, the 6-cluster gives the next largest gap statistic and should be the next best cluster to pick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote: In addition to these commonly used approaches, the NbClust package, published by Charrad et al., 2014, provides 30 indices for determining the relevant number of clusters and proposes to users the best clustering scheme from the different results obtained by varying all combinations of number of clusters, distance measures, and clustering methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class 6 notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\ndendogram without a cut-off is not useful\nthere will be several local optimisation points i.e. if extend to view more number of clusters, will likely see local optimal points there too. hence need to consider logic/other factors i.e. if have 80 points, no point having 20 clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the dendrogram displayed above, each leaf corresponds to one observation. As we move up the tree, observations that are similar to each other are combined into branches, which are themselves fused at a higher height.\nThe height of the fusion, provided on the vertical axis, indicates the (dis)similarity between two observations. The higher the height of the fusion, the less similar the observations are. Note that, conclusions about the proximity of two observations can be drawn only based on the height where branches containing those two observations first are fused. We cannot use the proximity of two observations along the horizontal axis as a criteria of their similarity.\nIt’s also possible to draw the dendrogram with a border around the selected clusters by using rect.hclust() of R stats. The argument border is used to specify the border colors for the rectangles.\n\nplot(hclust_ward, cex = 0.6)\nrect.hclust(hclust_ward,\n            k = 6,\n            border = 2:5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to perform visually-driven hiearchical clustering analysis using heatmaply package.\nWith heatmaply, we are able to build both highly interactive or static cluster heatmap.\n\n\nThe data was loaded into a data frame, but it has to be a data matrix to make your heatmap.\nThe code chunk below will be used to transform shan_ict data frame into a data matrix.\n\nshan_ict_mat &lt;- data.matrix(shan_ict)\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmaply() of heatmaply package is used to build an interactive cluster heatmap.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(shan_ict_mat),\n          Colv = NA,\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\",\n          seriate = \"OLO\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 6,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main = \"Geographic Segmentation of Shan State by ICT Indicators\",\n          xlab = \"ICT Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"Townships of Shan State\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith closed examination of the dendragram above, we have decided to retain six clusters.\ncutree() of R Base will be used in the code chunk below to derive a 6-cluster model.\n\ngroups &lt;- as.factor(cutree(hclust_ward, k=6))\n\nThe output is called groups. It is a list object.\nIn order to visualise the clusters, the groups object need to be appended onto shan_sf simple feature object.\nThe code chunk below form the join in three steps:\n\nthe groups list object will be converted into a matrix;\ncbind() is used to append groups matrix onto shan_sf to produce an output simple feature object called shan_sf_cluster; and\nrename() of dplyr package is used to rename as.matrix.groups field as CLUSTER.\n\n\nshan_sf_cluster &lt;- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %&gt;%\n  rename(`CLUSTER`=`as.matrix.groups.`)\n\nNext, qtm() of tmap package is used to plot the choropleth map showing the cluster formed:\n\nqtm(shan_sf_cluster,\"CLUSTER\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choropleth map above reveals the clusters are very fragmented. The is one of the major limitations when non-spatial clustering algorithm such as hierarchical cluster analysis method is used."

    "text": "In this section, we will derive spatially constrained cluster using skater() method of spdep package.\n\n\nFirst, we need to convert shan_sf into SpatialPolygonsDataFrame. This is because SKATER function only support sp objects such as SpatialPolygonDataFrame.\nThe code chunk below uses as_Spatial() of sf package to convert shan_sf into a SpatialPolygonDataFrame called shan_sp.\n\nshan_sp &lt;- as_Spatial(shan_sf)\n\n\n\n\nNext, poly2nd() of spdep package will be used to compute the neighbours list from polygon list.\n\nshan.nb &lt;- poly2nb(shan_sp)\nsummary(shan.nb)\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 55 \nNumber of nonzero links: 264 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 8.727273 \nAverage number of links: 4.8 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \n 5  9  7 21  4  3  5  1 \n5 least connected regions:\n3 5 7 9 47 with 2 links\n1 most connected region:\n8 with 9 links\n\n\nWe can plot the neighbours list on shan_sp using the code chunk below. Since we now can plot the community area boundaries as well, we plot this graph on top of the map. The first plot command gives the boundaries. This is followed by the plot of the neighbor list object, with coordinates applied to the original SpatialPolygonDataFrame (Shan state township boundaries) to extract the centroids of the polygons. These are used as the nodes for the graph representation. We also set the color to blue and specify add=TRUE to plot the network on top of the boundaries.\n\ncoords &lt;- st_coordinates(\n  st_centroid(st_geometry(shan_sf)))\n\n\nplot(st_geometry(shan_sf), \n     border=grey(.5))\nplot(shan.nb,\n     coords, \n     col=\"blue\", \n     add=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if you plot the network first and then the boundaries, some of the areas will be clipped. This is because the plotting area is determined by the characteristics of the first plot. In this example, because the boundary map extends further than the graph, we plot it first.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, nbcosts() of spdep package is used to compute the cost of each edge. It is the distance between it nodes. This function compute this distance using a data.frame with observations vector in each node.\nThe code chunk below is used to compute the cost of each edge.\n\nlcosts &lt;- nbcosts(shan.nb, shan_ict)\n\nFor each observation, this gives the pairwise dissimilarity between its values on the five variables and the values for the neighbouring observation (from the neighbour list). Basically, this is the notion of a generalised weight for a spatial weights matrix.\nNext, we will incorporate these costs into a weights object in the same way as we did in the calculation of inverse of distance weights. In other words, we convert the neighbour list to a list weights object by specifying the just computed lcosts as the weights.\nIn order to achieve this, nb2listw() of spdep package is used as shown in the code chunk below.\nNote that we specify the style as B to make sure the cost values are not row-standardised.\n\nshan.w &lt;- nb2listw(shan.nb, \n                   lcosts, \n                   style=\"B\")\nsummary(shan.w)\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 55 \nNumber of nonzero links: 264 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 8.727273 \nAverage number of links: 4.8 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \n 5  9  7 21  4  3  5  1 \n5 least connected regions:\n3 5 7 9 47 with 2 links\n1 most connected region:\n8 with 9 links\n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn       S0       S1        S2\nB 55 3025 76267.65 58260785 522016004\n\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is computed by mean of the mstree() of spdep package as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nshan.mst &lt;- mstree(shan.w)\n\nAfter computing the MST, we can check its class and dimension by using the code chunk below.\n\nclass(shan.mst)\n\n[1] \"mst\"    \"matrix\"\n\n\n\ndim(shan.mst)\n\n[1] 54  3\n\n\nNote that the dimension is 54 and not 55. This is because the minimum spanning tree consists on n-1 edges (links) in order to traverse all the nodes.\nWe can display the content of shan.mst by using head() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nhead(shan.mst)\n\n     [,1] [,2]      [,3]\n[1,]   54   48  47.79331\n[2,]   54   17 109.08506\n[3,]   54   45 127.42203\n[4,]   45   52 146.78891\n[5,]   52   13 110.55197\n[6,]   13   28  92.79567\n\n\nThe plot method for the MST include a way to show the observation numbers of the nodes in addition to the edge. As before, we plot this together with the township boundaries. We can see how the initial neighbour list is simplified to just one edge connecting each of the nodes, while passing through all the nodes.\n\nplot(st_geometry(shan_sf), \n                 border=gray(.5))\nplot.mst(shan.mst, \n         coords, \n         col=\"blue\", \n         cex.lab=0.7, \n         cex.circles=0.005, \n         add=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below compute the spatially constrained cluster using skater() of spdep package.\n\nclust6 &lt;- spdep::skater(edges = shan.mst[,1:2], \n                 data = shan_ict, \n                 method = \"euclidean\", \n                 ncuts = 5)\n\nThe skater() takes three mandatory arguments: - the first two columns of the MST matrix (i.e. not the cost), - the data matrix (to update the costs as units are being grouped), and - the number of cuts.\nNote: It is set to one less than the number of clusters. So, the value specified is not the number of clusters, but the number of cuts in the graph, one less than the number of clusters.\nThe result of the skater() is an object of class skater. We can examine its contents by using the code chunk below.\n\nstr(clust6)\n\nList of 8\n $ groups      : num [1:55] 3 3 6 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ edges.groups:List of 6\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num [1:22] 13 48 54 55 45 37 34 16 25 52 ...\n  .. ..$ edge: num [1:21, 1:3] 48 55 54 37 34 16 45 25 13 13 ...\n  .. ..$ ssw : num 3423\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num [1:18] 47 27 53 38 42 15 41 51 43 32 ...\n  .. ..$ edge: num [1:17, 1:3] 53 15 42 38 41 51 15 27 15 43 ...\n  .. ..$ ssw : num 3759\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num [1:11] 2 6 8 1 36 4 10 9 46 5 ...\n  .. ..$ edge: num [1:10, 1:3] 6 1 8 36 4 6 8 10 10 9 ...\n  .. ..$ ssw : num 1458\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num [1:2] 44 20\n  .. ..$ edge: num [1, 1:3] 44 20 95\n  .. ..$ ssw : num 95\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num 23\n  .. ..$ edge: num[0 , 1:3] \n  .. ..$ ssw : num 0\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num 3\n  .. ..$ edge: num[0 , 1:3] \n  .. ..$ ssw : num 0\n $ not.prune   : NULL\n $ candidates  : int [1:6] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n $ ssto        : num 12613\n $ ssw         : num [1:6] 12613 10977 9962 9540 9123 ...\n $ crit        : num [1:2] 1 Inf\n $ vec.crit    : num [1:55] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"skater\"\n\n\nThe most interesting component of this list structure is the groups vector containing the labels of the cluster to which each observation belongs (as before, the label itself is arbitary). This is followed by a detailed summary for each of the clusters in the edges.groups list.

    "text": "In this section, we will use functions provided by ClustGeo package to perform non-spatially constrained hierarchical cluster analysis and spatially constrained cluster analysis.\n\n\nClustGeo package is an R package specially designed to support the need of performing spatially constrained cluster analysis. More specifically, it provides a Ward-like hierarchical clustering algorithm called hclustgeo() including spatial/geographical constraints.\nIn the nutshell, the algorithm uses two dissimilarity matrices D0 and D1 along with a mixing parameter alpha, whereby the value of alpha must be a real number between [0, 1]. D0 can be non-Euclidean and the weights of the observations can be non-uniform. It gives the dissimilarities in the attribute/clustering variable space. D1, on the other hand, gives the dissimilarities in the constraint space. The criterion minimised at each stage is a convex combination of the homogeneity criterion calculated with D0 and the homogeneity criterion calculated with D1.\nThe idea is then to determine a value of alpha which increases the spatial contiguity without deteriorating too much the quality of the solution based on the variables of interest. This need is supported by a function called choicealpha().\n\n\n\nClustGeo package provides function called hclustgeo() to perform a typical Ward-like hierarchical clustering just like hclust() learned in previous section.\nTo perform non-spatially constrained hierarchical clustering, we only need to provide the function a dissimilarity matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nnongeo_cluster &lt;- hclustgeo(proxmat)\nplot(nongeo_cluster, cex = 0.5)\nrect.hclust(nongeo_cluster, \n            k = 6, \n            border = 2:5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the dissimilarity matrix must be an object of class dist, i.e. an object obtained with the function dist(). For sample code chunk, please refer to 5.7.6 Computing proximity matrix\n\n\nSimilarly, we can plot the clusters on a categorical area shaded map by using the steps we learned in 5.7.12 Mapping the clusters formed.\n\ngroups &lt;- as.factor(cutree(nongeo_cluster, k=6))\n\n\nshan_sf_ngeo_cluster &lt;- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %&gt;%\n  rename(`CLUSTER` = `as.matrix.groups.`)\n\n\nqtm(shan_sf_ngeo_cluster, \"CLUSTER\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can performed spatially constrained hierarchical clustering, a spatial distance matrix will be derived by using st_distance() of sf package.\n\ndist &lt;- st_distance(shan_sf, shan_sf)\ndistmat &lt;- as.dist(dist)\n\nNotice that as.dist() is used to convert the data frame into matrix.\nNext, choicealpha() will be used to determine a suitable value for the mixing parameter alpha as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncr &lt;- choicealpha(proxmat, distmat, range.alpha = seq(0, 1, 0.1), K=6, graph = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith reference to the graphs above, alpha = 0.3 will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class 6 notes from Prof Kam\n\n\n\nInterpreting the plots above:\n\nuse the raw version of the plot above to decide on the cut-off for alpha. the bottom plot is the normalised version.\nfor the raw version, towards the right, the red plot has stronger spatial compactness but lose attribute homogeneity. If want to focus on attribute compactness, look more towards the left. hence to objectively decide, look for the point where both plots cut each other i.e. compromise between spatial and attribute compactness\nk=6 will be obtained from the step above as there is no spatially constrained optimal number of clusters\n\n\n\n\nclustG &lt;- hclustgeo(proxmat, distmat, alpha = 0.3)\n\nNext, cutree() is used to derive the cluster object.\n\ngroups &lt;- as.factor(cutree(clustG, k=6))\n\nWe will then join back the group list with shan_sf polygon feature data frame by using the code chunk below.\n\nshan_sf_Gcluster &lt;- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %&gt;%\n  rename(`CLUSTER` = `as.matrix.groups.`)\n\nWe can now plot the map of the newly delineated spatially constrained clusters.\n\nqtm(shan_sf_Gcluster, \"CLUSTER\")"

This is followed by Cluster 2, 1, 4, 6 and 5.\n\n\n\nPast studies shown that parallel coordinate plot can be used to reveal clustering variables by cluster very effectively.

On the other hand, households in Cluster 5 tends to own the lowest of all the five ICT.\nNote that the scale argument of ggparcoor() provide several methods to scale the clustering variables. They are:\n\nstd: univariately, subtract mean and divide by standard deviation.\nrobust: univariately, subtract median and divide by median absolute deviation.\nuniminmax: univariately, scale so the minimum of the variable is zero, and the maximum is one.\nglobalminmax: no scaling is done; the range of the graphs is defined by the global minimum and the global maximum.\ncenter: use uniminmax to standardize vertical height, then center each variable at a value specified by the scaleSummary param.\ncenterObs: use uniminmax to standardize vertical height, then center each variable at the value of the observation specified by the centerObsID param\n\nThere is no one best scaling method to use - we will need to explore them and select the one that best meets the analysis need.\nLast but not least, we can also compute the summary statistics such as mean, median, sd, etc to complement the visual interpretation.\nIn the code chunk below, group_by() and summarise() of dplyr are used to derive mean values of the clustering variables.\n\nshan_sf_ngeo_cluster %&gt;% \n  st_set_geometry(NULL) %&gt;%\n  group_by(CLUSTER) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_RADIO_PR = mean(RADIO_PR),\n            mean_TV_PR = mean(TV_PR),\n            mean_LLPHONE_PR = mean(LLPHONE_PR),\n            mean_MPHONE_PR = mean(MPHONE_PR),\n            mean_COMPUTER_PR = mean(COMPUTER_PR))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  CLUSTER mean_RADIO_PR mean_TV_PR mean_LLPHONE_PR mean_MPHONE_PR\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 1               221.        521.            44.2           246.\n2 2               237.        402.            23.9           134.\n3 3               300.        611.            52.2           392.\n4 4               196.        744.            99.0           651.\n5 5               124.        224.            38.0           132.\n6 6                98.6       499.            74.5           468.\n# ℹ 1 more variable: mean_COMPUTER_PR &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class 6 notes from Prof Kam:\n\n\n\n\nstandardisation is important for hierarchical clustering because its distance-based and when units of measurement are different, you want to avoid the data analysis being skewed by data with larger units\nhowever in this case, while we had carried out standardisation in this exercise, we note that the distribution of the variables are not wide-ranging and hence can just use the unstandardised data for analysis\nvariable standaridsation techniques: Z-score has no max while min-max is constrained between 0 and 1. another standardisation method decimal scaling helps to spread the data i.e. data from satellites, remote sensing technologies"

It is in WGS84 geographic coordinate system.\n\n\n\nNext, we will import Hunan_GDPPC.csv into R using read_csv() of readr package. The output is in R data frame class.\n\nGDPPC &lt;- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/Hunan_GDPPC.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nWe use spacetime() of sfdep to create a spatio-temporal cube:\n\nGDPPC_st &lt;- spacetime(GDPPC,hunan,\n                      .loc_col = \"County\",\n                      .time_col = \"Year\")\n\n\nthe above code explicitly indicates which attribute is spatial (“.loc_col”) and which attribute is the time (“.time_col”)\nnote that cannot use original time or date field as its in continuous form and might not be integer i.e. cannot use real number/number that have decimal places, hence prior to this step, might need to explicitly convert date into integer (via lubridate) or rmb to drop away the date to have continuous day, month, year indicator.\ncannot use this method if boundary change i.e. those phenomena with dynamic space such as flooding that cover a large area then recede to cover smaller area, what can be changed are attributes i.e. occurrences of accidents - as long as hexagon remain the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote this step for Take-home Exercise 2\n\n\nWe use the following code chunk to verify if GDPPC_st is indeed a space-time cube object:\n\nis_spacetime_cube(GDPPC_st)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nIt is always good practice to check via the above step\nVia the “Environment” tab, we note that GDPPC_st has several layers according to different time periods vs the original GDPPC file. However, this difference is not obvious when you click to open up the GDPPC_st file."

    "text": "Tourism is one of Thailand’s largest industries, accounting for ~20% of the gross domestic product (GDP). In 2019, Thailand earned US$90 billion from domestic and international tourism, but the COVID-19 pandemic caused revenues to crash to US$24 billion in 2020.\nThe figure below shows the total revenue receipt from tourism sector between Jan 2019 to Feb 2023, and indicates that the revenue from tourism industry has been gradually recovering since Sep 2021.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the tourism economy of Thailand is not evenly distributed. The figure below reveals that the tourism economy of Thailand in 2019 was mainly focused on five provinces, namely Bangkok, Phuket, Chon Buri, Krabi and Chiang Mai.\n\n\n\nThe objectives of this take-home exercise will be to discover:\n\nif the key indicators of tourism economy of Thailand are independent from space and space and time.\nIf the tourism economy is indeed spatial and spatio-temporal dependent, and if so, where the clusters, outliers and emerging hot spot/cold spot areas are.\n\n\n\n\nThe specific tasks of this take-home exercise are as follows:\n\nUsing appropriate function of sf and tidyverse, prepare the following geospatial data layer:\n\na study area layer in sf polygon features. It must be at province level (including Bangkok) of Thailand.\na tourism economy indicators layer within the study area in sf polygon features.\na derived tourism economy indicator layer in spacetime s3 class of sfdep. Keep the time series at month and year levels.\n\nUsing the extracted data, perform global spatial autocorrelation analysis using sfdep methods.\nUsing the extracted data, perform local spatial autocorrelation analysis using sfdep methods.\nUsing the extracted data, perform emerging hotspot analysis using sfdep methods.\nDescribe the spatial patterns revealed by the analysis above.\n\n\n\n\nWe use the following code chunk to install and load the necessary R packages for our analysis:\n\npacman::p_load(sf, sfdep, tmap, tidyverse, knitr, plotly, Kendall, VIM, naniar, DT)\n\n\n\n\nTwo data sets shall be used:\n\nThailand Domestic Tourism Statistics at Kaggle - version 2 of the data set will be used.\nThailand - Subnational Administrative Boundaries at HDX - the province boundary data set will be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses read_csv() of readr package to load the Thailand Domestic Tourism Statistics:\n\ntourism &lt;- read_csv(\"data/rawdata/thailand_domestic_tourism_2019_2023_ver2.csv\")\n\nThe thai_tourism data has 30,800 rows and 7 variables, namely date, province_thai, province_eng, region_thai, region_eng, variable and value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will drop the columns province_thai and region_thai as these variables are in the Thai language which we do not understand and hence will not be helpful for our analysis:\n\ntourism &lt;- tourism[,!names(tourism) %in% c(\"province_thai\",\"region_thai\")]\n\n\n\n\nWe determine the presence of missing values using the vis_miss() function of the naniar package:\n\nvis_miss(tourism)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the output above, we note that there are no missing data.\n\n\n\nFrom the code chunk below, we note that the date variable in tourism data frame is in the Date vector format:\n\nclass(tourism$date)\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\nWe form new variables year and month using the lubridate package:\n\ntourism &lt;- tourism %&gt;%\n  mutate(year_month = ymd(date),\n         year = year(date),\n         month = month(date,\n                       label = TRUE,\n                       abbr = TRUE),\n.before = 2)\n\n\n\n\nWe first study the distribution of regions in the data:\n\nggplot(tourism, \n       aes(x = fct_reorder(region_eng, region_eng, .fun = length))) + \n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of domestic tourism statistics across regions\", x = \"Regions\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the output above, we note that there 5 different types of regions represented, notably the western region is not represented in the data.\nWe take a more detailed look by determining the unique provinces represented in the data and their corresponding regions. This step aims to check for two things:\n\nwhether there are any duplicate data entries i.e. entries that are meant to represent the same province but have spelling errors.\nwhether the regions for the provinces are accurately indicated\n\n\ntourism_unique &lt;- tourism %&gt;%\n  select(province_eng,region_eng) %&gt;%\n  distinct() %&gt;%\n  arrange(region_eng,province_eng)\n\ntourism_unique\n\n# A tibble: 77 × 2\n   province_eng             region_eng\n   &lt;chr&gt;                    &lt;chr&gt;     \n 1 Ang Thong                central   \n 2 Bangkok                  central   \n 3 Chainat                  central   \n 4 Kanchanaburi             central   \n 5 Lopburi                  central   \n 6 Nakhon Pathom            central   \n 7 Nonthaburi               central   \n 8 Pathum Thani             central   \n 9 Phetchaburi              central   \n10 Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya central   \n# ℹ 67 more rows\n\n\nFrom the output above, we note that all 77 Thailand provinces are represented in the data, and that there are no spelling errors/misrepresented provinces.\nHowever, with reference to the source on provinces in Thailand, we note a few mistakes in the regions indicated for the provinces.\n\nKanchanaburi, Phetchaburi, Prachuap Khiri Khan and Ratchaburi are stated as being in the central region but actually reside in the west region\nNakhon Nayok is stated as being in the east region but actually resides in the central region\nThe east_northeast region can actually be renamed as northeast region for clarity and consistency with how detailed the other provinces are labelled\nKamphaeng Phet, Nakhon Sawan, Phetchabun, Phichit, Phitsanulok, Sukhothai and Uthai Thani are stated as being in the north region but actually reside in central region\nTak is stated as being in the north region but actually resides in the west region\nSisaket is stated as being in the south region but actually resides in the northeast region\n\n\n\n\nWe use the code chunk below to rename the “east_northeast” region to just “northeast” and correct the erroneous regions of the provinces mentioned above:\n\ntourism &lt;- tourism %&gt;%\n  mutate(region_eng = case_when(\n    region_eng == \"east_northeast\" ~ \"northeast\",\n    province_eng %in% c(\"Kanchanaburi\", \"Phetchaburi\", \"Prachuap Khiri Khan\", \"Ratchaburi\", \"Tak\") ~ \"west\",\n    province_eng %in% c(\"Nakhon Nayok\",\"Kamphaeng Phet\",\"Nakhon Sawan\",\"Phetchabun\",\"Phichit\",\"Phitsanulok\",\"Sukhothai\",\"Uthai Thani\") ~ \"central\",\n    province_eng == \"Sisaket\" ~ \"northeast\",\n    TRUE ~ region_eng\n  ))\n\nWe check by generating the data table of provinces and their corresponding regions:\n\ntourism_unique &lt;- tourism %&gt;%\n  select(province_eng,region_eng) %&gt;%\n  distinct() %&gt;%\n  arrange(region_eng,province_eng)\n\ndatatable(tourism_unique)\n\n\n\n\n\nRe-plotting the distribution of domestic tourism statistics across the regions:\n\nggplot(tourism, \n       aes(x = fct_reorder(region_eng, region_eng, .fun = length))) + \n  geom_bar(fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of domestic tourism statistics across regions\", x = \"Regions\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe note that most of the domestic tourism statistics come from the central region, followed by northeast, south, north, east and finally the west region.\n\n\n\n\nggplot(tourism, \n       aes(x = fct_reorder(variable, variable, .fun = length))) + \n  geom_bar(fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Variable\", x = \"Variable\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe note that there are 8 different types of variables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS/N\nVariable\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\n1\nno_tourist_all\nThe total number of domestic tourists who visited the province\n\n\n2\nno_tourist_thai\nThe number of Thai tourists who visited the province\n\n\n3\nno_tourist_foreign\nThe number of foreign tourists who visited the province\n\n\n4\nno_tourist_stay\nThe total number of occupied hotel rooms in the province\n\n\n5\nratio_tourist_stay\nThe percentage of occupied travel accommodation in the province\n\n\n6\nrevenue_all\nThe revenue generated by the tourism industry in the province, in Thai Baht\n\n\n7\nrevenue_foreign\nThe revenue generated by foreign tourists in the province, in Thai Baht\n\n\n8\nrevenue_thai\nThe revenue generated by Thai tourists in the province, in Thai Baht\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe utilise the pivot_wider() function to separate the different variable types as individual columns:\n\ntourism_wider &lt;- tourism %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = value)\n\n\n\n\nBased on the definition of the different variable types, we note that “revenue_all” should equal to the sum of “revenue_foreign” and “revenue_thai”.

    "text": "Tourism is one of Thailand’s largest industries, accounting for ~20% of the gross domestic product (GDP). In 2019, Thailand earned US$90 billion from domestic and international tourism, but the COVID-19 pandemic caused revenues to crash to US$24 billion in 2020.\nThe figure below shows the total revenue receipt from tourism sector between Jan 2019 to Feb 2023, and indicates that the revenue from tourism industry has been gradually recovering since Sep 2021.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the tourism economy of Thailand is not evenly distributed. The figure below reveals that the tourism economy of Thailand in 2019 was mainly focused on five provinces, namely Bangkok, Phuket, Chon Buri, Krabi and Chiang Mai."

It is in WGS84 geographic coordinate system.\n\n\n\nOf the fields available, only “ADM1_EN” and “geometry” are essential hence the following code chunk keeps only these two variables in the simple features object:\n\nprovince &lt;- province %&gt;%\n  select(ADM1_EN)\n\n\n\n\nAs we will be joining the province simple features object and the attribute data from tourism_cleaned using the province names (ADM1_EN in province simple features object and province_eng in tourism_cleaned dataframe), it is important to check through the naming of the provinces to ensure that they all match up.\nWe extract the unique province names from both tourism_cleaned and province:\n\nunique_tour_prov &lt;- tourism_cleaned %&gt;%\n  distinct(province_eng)\n\n\nunique_shp_prov &lt;- province %&gt;%\n  distinct(ADM1_EN)\n\nWe then combine via a full join and read through the list of province names for discrepancies:\n\ncombined_prov &lt;- full_join(unique_shp_prov,unique_tour_prov,\n                           by = c(\"ADM1_EN\"=\"province_eng\"))\n\n\ncombined_prov &lt;- combined_prov %&gt;%\n  arrange(ADM1_EN)\n\ncombined_prov\n\n                    ADM1_EN\n1             Amnat Charoen\n2                 Ang Thong\n3                   Bangkok\n4                 Bueng Kan\n5                  Buri Ram\n6                   Buriram\n7              Chachoengsao\n8                  Chai Nat\n9                   Chainat\n10               Chaiyaphum\n11              Chanthaburi\n12               Chiang Mai\n13               Chiang Rai\n14                Chon Buri\n15                 Chonburi\n16                 Chumphon\n17                  Kalasin\n18           Kamphaeng Phet\n19             Kanchanaburi\n20                Khon Kaen\n21                    Krabi\n22                  Lampang\n23                  Lamphun\n24                     Loei\n25                 Lop Buri\n26                  Lopburi\n27             Mae Hong Son\n28            Maha Sarakham\n29                 Mukdahan\n30             Nakhon Nayok\n31            Nakhon Pathom\n32            Nakhon Phanom\n33        Nakhon Ratchasima\n34             Nakhon Sawan\n35      Nakhon Si Thammarat\n36                      Nan\n37               Narathiwat\n38         Nong Bua Lam Phu\n39          Nong Bua Lamphu\n40                Nong Khai\n41               Nonthaburi\n42             Pathum Thani\n43                  Pattani\n44                Phang Nga\n45                 Phangnga\n46              Phatthalung\n47                   Phayao\n48               Phetchabun\n49              Phetchaburi\n50                  Phichit\n51              Phitsanulok\n52 Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya\n53                    Phrae\n54                   Phuket\n55             Prachin Buri\n56              Prachinburi\n57      Prachuap Khiri Khan\n58                   Ranong\n59               Ratchaburi\n60                   Rayong\n61                   Roi Et\n62                  Sa Kaeo\n63             Sakon Nakhon\n64             Samut Prakan\n65             Samut Sakhon\n66          Samut Songkhram\n67                 Saraburi\n68                    Satun\n69                Si Sa Ket\n70                Sing Buri\n71                  Sisaket\n72                 Songkhla\n73                Sukhothai\n74              Suphan Buri\n75              Surat Thani\n76                    Surin\n77                      Tak\n78                    Trang\n79                     Trat\n80         Ubon Ratchathani\n81               Udon Thani\n82              Uthai Thani\n83                Uttaradit\n84                     Yala\n85                 Yasothon\n\n\nWe note repeated entries for eight provinces which are spelt differently in the original province sf object vs tourism_cleaned dataframe:\n\nBuri Ram vs Buriram\nChai Nat vs Chainat\nChon Buri vs Chonburi\nLop Buri vs Lopburi\nNong Bua Lam Phu vs Nong Bua Lamphu\nPhangnga vs Phang Nga\nPrachin Buri vs Prachinburi\nSi Sa Ket vs Sisaket\n\n\n\n\nWe utilise the following code chunk to adjust the naming of the eight provinces to be aligned with the naming in the tourism_cleaned dataframe to faciliate relational join in subsequent analysis.

As we are working with multipolygons, we will need to get points to make connectivity graphs. As such, we will get the latitude and longitude of polygon centroids. To do this, we will use a mapping function. The mapping function applies a given function to each element of a vector and returns a vector of the same length. Our input vector will be the geometry column of us.bound. Our function will be st_centroid. We will be using map_dbl variation of map from the purrr package.\nTo get our longitude values we map the st_centroid function over the geometry column of us.bound and access the longitude value through double bracket notation [[]] and 1. This allows us to get only the longitude, which is the first value in each centroid.\n\nlongitude &lt;- map_dbl(province$geometry,~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])\n\nWe do the same for latitude but by accessing the second value per each centroid with [[2]].\n\nlatitude &lt;- map_dbl(province$geometry,~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])\n\nWe then use cbind to put longitude and latitude into the same object:\n\ncoords &lt;- cbind(longitude,latitude)\n\nWe check the first few observations to ensure that things are formatted correctly:\n\nhead(coords)\n\n     longitude latitude\n[1,]  100.6235 13.77183\n[2,]  100.7102 13.59651\n[3,]  100.3928 13.92416\n[4,]  100.6824 14.06513\n[5,]  100.5266 14.34535\n[6,]  100.3485 14.62354\n\n\n\n\n6.1 Determining whether key indicators are independent of space\n\n\n6.2 Determining whether key indicators are independent of space and time\n\n\n6.1.1 Total Revenue\n\n\n6.1.2 Revenue generated by foreign tourists\n\n\n6.1.3 Revenue generated by Thai tourists\n\n\n6.2 Tourist Numbers\n\n\n6.1.1 Total number of tourists\n\n\n6.1.2 Number of foreign tourists\n\n\n6.1.3 Number of Thai tourists\n\n\n6.3 Occupancy Rate"
